1.1,835,254,30%,"This essay revisits a question that has shaped every era of human history: what are the proper limits of authority over the individual? Not free will versus determinism, but the concrete, political question of when society may legitimately constrain a person's liberty. As political structures, social dynamics, and technology evolve, these limits must be continually reassessed. The question is ancient, but modern conditions demand a fundamentally different treatment of it.","THE SUBJECT of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, so unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far from being new, that, in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more civilized portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment.","In this book I speak not of free will but freedom of action. Many have addressed this subject throughout history but with recent changes in power structures, social structures, and technology I want to address it in a modern context (On Libery was written in 1859)","This essay is not about free will. It is about what power society may rightfully exercise over the individual. The question is as old as civilization, yet every generation must answer it anew, because the conditions under which authority operates never stop changing.","The essay addresses the legitimate limits of society's power over individuals, not the philosophical question of free will. Though the question is ancient, modern conditions demand it be reconsidered.","Not free will, but what authority over individuals is just -- and why progress forces us to keep revisiting it.",1,1,,On Liberty,JSM,Test,"Philosophical Necessity -- Mill refers to the determinism debate (whether human actions are causally determined), which he addressed separately in A System of Logic (1843) and later in An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865). He deliberately sets this aside to focus on political liberty.

Plato's Republic (c. 375 BCE) -- The question of authority over individuals is raised by Plato, who proposed philosopher-kings and noble lies to maintain the Just City.

The framing of liberty as requiring 'different and more fundamental treatment' under modern conditions signals Mill's awareness that industrial society, mass democracy, and new communications technologies (the penny press, the telegraph) had changed the mechanisms of social control since earlier treatments by Locke, Montesquieu, and others."
1.2,1654,695,42%,"Through most of recorded history, the struggle between liberty and authority -- whether in Greece, Rome, or England -- was a struggle between the governed and their rulers. Liberty meant constraining rulers who stood in natural opposition to the people: a king, a caste, or a conquering group whose authority did not rest on the consent of the governed. Their power was seen as necessary to maintain order, yet it was also dangerous -- the same force meant to preserve peace could shield corruption and suppress legitimate dissent. Limiting this power was the essence of what was called liberty, and it was pursued in two primary ways.","The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the Government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed on by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying upon the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways.","The debate and struggle between liberty and authority has shaped history, especially in Greece, Rome, and England. Rulers, who usually gaind authority from conquest or inheritance, were seen as necessary to maintain order, yet were also known to exploit their subjects. To curb this predatory power and provide structure for resistance, two core ideas emerged.","The tension between liberty and authority runs through all recorded history, most visibly in Greece, Rome, and England. Authority, rooted in conquest or inheritance, was tolerated for the order it provided, even as it preyed upon the people it claimed to protect. To restrain it, two principles were forged.","History shows a recurring struggle between liberty and authority. Rulers were necessary for order but posed a constant threat of exploitation, so two methods emerged to check their power.",Liberty began as the project of restraining rulers who were both necessary and dangerous.,1,2,,,,,"Greece, Rome, and England -- Mill selects these as the canonical examples of the liberty-authority struggle familiar to a Victorian educated audience.

Greek popular governments -- Mill's parenthetical exception refers to Athenian democracy (5th-4th century BCE), where rulers were not conceived as antagonistic to the people because citizens governed themselves directly.

The 'vulture' metaphor -- Mill's image of a stronger predator commissioned to keep down lesser ones echoes Hobbes's Leviathan (1651), where the sovereign is a necessary concentration of power to prevent the war of all against all.

Magna Carta (1215) -- The foundational English document limiting royal authority.
Hungary's Golden Bull (1222) -- A parallel European charter of noble rights.
Model Parliament (1295) -- Edward I's parliament, an early step toward representative consent."
1.3,271,371,137%,"The first method was the recognition of rights -- specific immunities that rulers were duty-bound to respect. If a ruler violated these protections, resistance or rebellion was considered justified.","First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which, if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. ","The first method was to secure recognition of specific protections, known as political liberties or rights. If a ruler violated these, it was considered a breach of duty, and resistance, or even outright rebellion, was justified.","The first safeguard: defined rights. If rulers violated them, rebellion was not treason but justice.",The first check on authority was establishing recognized rights whose violation justified resistance or rebellion.,"Rights drew a line: cross it, and resistance becomes legitimate.",1,3,,,,,"English Bill of Rights (1689) -- Established after the Glorious Revolution, codifying limits on the Crown and affirming parliamentary supremacy.

Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) -- The French revolutionary document asserting natural and civil rights.

The concept of justified rebellion echoes John Locke's Second Treatise of Government (1689), which argued that government forfeits its legitimacy when it violates the natural rights of the people."
1.4,283,175,62%,"The second method, generally later in development, was the establishment of constitutional checks: mechanisms requiring those in power to obtain the consent of the community, or its representatives, before taking significant action.","A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks, by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power.","The second, approach was to create constitutional checks. Meaning certain major decision to required the consent of the people, or at least a body meant to represent its interests.","The second safeguard: constitutional checks, ensuring that major acts of power required the consent of the governed or their representatives.",The second check on authority was constitutional mechanisms that made major government actions contingent on community or representative approval.,Constitutional checks made consent a prerequisite for the exercise of power.,1,4,,,,,"Constitutional checks -- Mill refers to the gradual development of parliamentary sovereignty, from the Magna Carta's requirement of baronial consent for taxation through the English Civil War (1642-1651) and the establishment of parliamentary supremacy after the Glorious Revolution (1688).

The distinction between rights (negative protections) and constitutional checks (procedural requirements) maps roughly onto the later legal distinction between substantive and procedural due process."
1.5,551,292,53%,"In most European countries, rulers eventually conceded certain rights but resisted constitutional checks. Securing those checks therefore became the central objective of advocates of liberty. Yet during this entire period, people accepted the basic arrangement: they were willing to be ruled by a master, so long as his power could be held within limits. Their aspirations did not yet extend beyond constraining authority -- they had not yet imagined replacing it.","To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and, to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point.",,"Rights were grudgingly conceded; constitutional checks had to be fought for. But the aspiration remained modest: not to abolish authority, only to cage it.","Rulers accepted rights more readily than constitutional checks, making the latter the primary goal of liberty advocates. People still accepted being ruled, provided authority was kept within bounds.","Early liberty meant taming authority, not transcending it.",1,5,,,,,"Mill traces a progression: rights were extracted first (often through crisis or revolution), while constitutional checks -- requiring ongoing institutional mechanisms like parliaments -- took longer to establish and were more fiercely resisted because they represented a structural, permanent limitation on sovereign discretion.

The phrase 'combat one enemy by another' reflects the Hobbesian bargain: accepting a powerful sovereign to protect against worse threats, whether foreign invasion or civil disorder."
1.6,2150,735,34%,"Eventually, people stopped accepting that their rulers should be an independent, opposing force. They came to believe that officials should be chosen by the people, accountable to them, and removable at their pleasure. This demand for elected, temporary rulers became the central aim of liberal reform, gradually displacing the older project of merely limiting power.

As this ideal gained ground, a further assumption took hold: once government truly represented the people's will, further restraints on its power were unnecessary. The nation's power was the people's own power, merely concentrated into a convenient form. Why fear your own authority exercised on your own behalf? Across most of continental Europe, this view became dominant. Only a few exceptional thinkers argued that even democratic governments still needed limits.","A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an independent power, opposed in interest to themselves. It appeared to them much better that the various magistrates of the State should be their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. In that way alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers of government would never be abused to their disadvantage. By degrees this new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed; and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit the power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself. That (it might seem) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people. What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will. There was no fear of its tyrannizing over itself. Let the rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made. Their power was but the nation’s own power, concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. This mode of thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section of which it still apparently predominates. Those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the Continent. A similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered.",,"A new idea emerged: rulers should not be an opposing force but delegates of the people, elected and removable. And if government truly expressed the people's will, why limit it at all? The nation's power was the people's own power. Across Europe, this reasoning took hold -- and very few voices questioned it.","Liberal reformers shifted from limiting rulers to replacing them with elected representatives. Many then concluded that democratic government needed no further constraints, since it expressed the people's own will.","Once people believed government was their own instrument, they stopped seeing any reason to restrain it.",1,6,,,,,"The 'last generation of European liberalism' -- Mill refers to the post-Napoleonic liberal movements across Europe, particularly the revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and thinkers like Benjamin Constant and Francois Guizot.

The Continental section -- Mill distinguishes between Continental liberalism (which embraced popular sovereignty with fewer reservations) and British liberalism (which retained deeper skepticism of concentrated power, shaped by the English constitutional tradition).

The idea that the people's power needs no limitation echoes Rousseau's Social Contract (1762), where the general will is by definition always right.

Mill's observation that Britain diverged reflects the influence of thinkers like Burke, who emphasized institutional checks even against democratic majorities, and the particular British experience of gradual reform rather than revolutionary rupture."
1.7,2376,690,29%,"Experience exposed the flaw in this reasoning. While democracy remained theoretical or belonged only to ancient history, it was easy to believe that self-governing people could never oppress themselves. Even the excesses of the French Revolution could be dismissed as the work of a usurping minority, not a defect of popular institutions as such. But once a democratic republic occupied a large portion of the earth and became one of the world's most powerful nations, the theory was tested against reality.

The results were sobering. 'Self-government' turned out not to mean each person governing themselves, but each being governed by all the rest. The 'will of the people' in practice meant the will of the majority -- or of those who successfully presented themselves as the majority. And that majority could desire to oppress a minority just as ruthlessly as any monarch. The need to limit government power does not diminish when power is held by elected officials accountable to the strongest faction. 'The tyranny of the majority' became a recognized danger requiring its own safeguards.","But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from observation. The notion, that the people have no need to limit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular government was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the French Revolution, the worst of which were the work of an usurping few, and which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchical and aristocratic despotism. In time, however, a democratic republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth’s surface, and made itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations; and elective and responsible government became subject to the observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It was now perceived that such phrases as “self-government,” and “the power of the people over themselves,” do not express the true state of the case. The “people” who exercise the power are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised; and the “self-government” spoken of is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest. The will of the people, moreover, practically means the will of the most numerous or the most active
part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority; the people, consequently,
may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this as against any other abuse of power. The limitation, therefore, of the power of government over individuals loses none of its importance when the holders of power are regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest party therein. This view of things, recommending itself equally to the intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and in political speculations “the tyranny of the majority” is now generally included among the evils against which society requires to be on its guard.",,Success exposed what theory had concealed. 'Self-government' did not mean each person governing themselves but each being governed by all the rest. The 'will of the people' meant the will of the majority -- or those who claimed to be. And majorities can oppress minorities as effectively as any king. Democracy does not retire the need for limits on power; it proves it.,"Once democracy moved from theory to practice, it became clear that 'the will of the people' really means the will of the majority, which can oppress minorities. Limiting government power remains essential even under democratic rule.","Democracy revealed that self-government is not government of each by themselves, but of each by all the rest.",1,7,,,,,"A democratic republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface -- Mill refers to the United States of America, whose rapid territorial expansion and growing global influence by the mid-19th century provided the first large-scale test of democratic governance.

Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1835, 1840) -- Tocqueville coined the phrase 'tyranny of the majority' and provided the most influential analysis of this danger, which Mill explicitly acknowledges as a recognized concept in political thought.

The French Revolution (1789-1799) -- Mill concedes that its worst excesses (the Terror, 1793-1794) could be attributed to a usurping faction (the Jacobins under Robespierre) rather than to popular self-governance itself.

James Madison, Federalist No. 10 (1787) -- The American constitutional concern with faction and majority tyranny anticipated many of Mill's points, though Mill does not cite Madison directly."
1.8,1633,740,45%,"But government is only one channel through which collective power operates. Society itself can be the tyrant, and its methods of coercion are not limited to what it does through the state. Social pressure -- the weight of prevailing opinion, custom, and expectation -- may not carry legal penalties, but it penetrates more deeply into daily life and leaves fewer avenues of escape. It can impose conformity on those who diverge, stifling individuality before it has the chance to form, and compelling people to fashion themselves according to a single approved model.

Protecting liberty therefore requires more than constitutional limits on government. It demands a boundary on the authority of collective opinion itself. Finding that boundary, and defending it against encroachment, is as essential to human flourishing as protection against political despotism.","Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of the public authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant—society collectively, over the separate individuals who compose it—its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs, as protection against political despotism.",,"The majority does not tyrannize only through law. Social pressure penetrates deeper than any statute, enforcing conformity not by punishment but by suffocation. It leaves fewer means of escape and can crush individuality before it forms. Liberty requires protection not only against the state, but against the despotism of prevailing opinion.","Society exerts tyranny not just through government but through social pressure, which penetrates more deeply into life and is harder to escape. Liberty requires limits on collective opinion, not just on political power.",Social pressure is more insidious than law: it does not punish dissent so much as prevent it from forming.,1,8,,,,,"Mill's distinction between political tyranny and social tyranny is one of his most original contributions. While Tocqueville had identified the 'tyranny of the majority' primarily in political terms, Mill extends it to the informal mechanisms of social coercion -- what he elsewhere calls 'the tyranny of prevailing opinion and feeling.'

'Enslaving the soul itself' -- Mill's language echoes concerns about conformity that would later be developed by thinkers like Kierkegaard (The Present Age, 1846), Nietzsche, and in the 20th century by Erich Fromm (Escape from Freedom, 1941) and Hannah Arendt.

The idea that social tyranny can 'prevent the formation of any individuality' anticipates Michel Foucault's later analysis of disciplinary power and normalization (Discipline and Punish, 1975)."
1.9,873,684,78%,"Yet everything that makes life valuable depends on some restraint of individual conduct. Rules must exist -- enforced by law where appropriate, and by social opinion where law is unsuitable. The real question is what those rules should be, and it is one of the least settled questions in human affairs. Beyond a few obvious cases, almost no consensus exists. No two eras, and scarcely any two countries, have drawn this boundary in the same place, and each is astonished by the judgments of the other.

This is the foundational problem: how should society determine the proper limits between individual freedom and collective control?","But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general terms, the practical question, where to place the limit—how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control—is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct, therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law. What these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which least progress has been made in resolving. No two ages, and scarcely any two countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or country is a wonder to another.",,"Life requires rules -- some enforced by law, others by social pressure. But which rules, and where the line falls between freedom and control, is one of the least resolved questions in human history. No two ages or nations have answered it alike, and each finds the other's answer bewildering.","Some restraints on conduct are necessary for society to function, but humanity has made almost no progress in determining which restraints are legitimate. The boundary between freedom and control varies wildly across time and place.",Everyone agrees that some rules are necessary; almost no one agrees on which ones.,1,9,,,,,"Mill's claim that 'least progress has been made' in resolving the question of legitimate social rules echoes his broader philosophy of progress. In A System of Logic (1843) and elsewhere, he argued that the moral sciences lagged far behind the natural sciences in establishing reliable principles.

The observation that different ages and countries reach contradictory conclusions on moral regulation reflects the influence of comparative and historical approaches to ethics that emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly through Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws (1748), which showed how laws and customs varied with climate, culture, and political structure."
1.10,966,677,70%,"Yet people rarely notice how unsettled the question is. The norms of any given era feel obvious and self-justifying, as though they expressed some natural truth about how life should be lived. This is the power of custom: it becomes so deeply ingrained that people mistake it for human nature itself, and the possibility of questioning it barely arises. Because these social rules feel unquestionable, people seldom think they need reasons for them -- either when explaining them to others or when examining their own beliefs. Many come to believe, often with encouragement from those who claim authority, that their feelings on such matters are better than reasons and make reasons unnecessary.","Yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is continually mistaken for the first. The effect of custom, in preventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself. People are accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by some who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, on subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasons unnecessary.",,"Custom is so powerful that people mistake it for nature. The norms of every era feel self-evident to those living under them, and questioning them rarely occurs to anyone. When feeling is treated as superior to reason, the demand for justification disappears entirely.","People treat the norms of their own time as self-evident truths rather than customs. Because these norms feel natural, people rarely seek or offer reasons for them, relying on feeling instead.","Custom masquerades as nature, and feeling displaces reason, so the norms of every era escape examination.",1,10,,,,,"Mill's argument about custom being mistaken for nature draws on a long philosophical tradition. Montaigne's Essays (1580) argued that 'the principal effect of custom is to seize and ensnare us.' Pascal made a similar point: 'Custom is our nature' (Pensees, 1670).

'Some who aspire to the character of philosophers' -- Mill likely refers to intuitionist moral philosophers, particularly William Whewell, whose moral philosophy (Elements of Morality, 1845) held that moral truths are self-evident and apprehended by a moral sense rather than derived from reason or utility. Mill explicitly attacked Whewell's intuitionism in his essay on Whewell (1852).

The broader target is the 'moral sense' tradition from Shaftesbury and Hutcheson through the Scottish Enlightenment, which held that moral judgments are delivered by an innate faculty rather than by rational deliberation."
1.11,1158,518,45%,"In practice, what guides most people's views on how others should behave is simply the feeling that everyone should act as they and their allies would prefer. No one admits that their standard of judgment is merely personal preference. But an opinion on conduct that rests on no reasons beyond that preference is exactly that -- one person's liking. And when reasons are offered, they usually amount to an appeal to the same preference felt by others, which makes it many people's liking rather than one person's, but no more principled.

For most people, this shared preference is the only basis they have for judging what is admirable or blameworthy, outside of whatever their religious creed explicitly prescribes. And even their interpretation of that creed is usually shaped by the same unexamined feelings."," The practical principle which guides them to their opinions on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person’s mind that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he sympathizes, would like them to act. No one, indeed, acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinion on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one person’s preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appeal to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only many people’s liking instead of one. To an ordinary man, however, his own preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that. Men’s opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blameable, are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject.",,"Most moral judgment reduces to this: everyone should act the way I want them to. No one admits this, but an opinion unsupported by reasons is just a preference -- and a preference shared by millions is still a preference, not a principle.","People's moral judgments typically rest on personal preference rather than reasoned principles. Even when shared widely, preferences remain preferences. Religious doctrine is usually interpreted through the same unexamined feelings.","A preference held by a million people is still a preference, not a principle.",1,11,,,,,"Mill's reduction of unreasoned moral opinion to 'liking' connects to his broader utilitarian project of grounding ethics in demonstrable consequences rather than intuition or sentiment.

The critique of treating shared sentiment as moral authority challenges Hume's observation that morality is 'more properly felt than judged of' (A Treatise of Human Nature, 1739). Mill agrees with Hume that people do in fact rely on feeling, but unlike Hume, he sees this as a problem to be corrected rather than a feature of moral psychology to be accepted.

Mill's point about religious interpretation being shaped by prior preferences anticipates the hermeneutic circle -- the idea that interpreters bring preexisting assumptions to any text, including scripture."
1.12,1063,445,42%,"The forces shaping these preferences are various and unreliable: sometimes reason, but more often prejudice, superstition, envy, arrogance, fear, or self-interest. Wherever a dominant class exists, a large portion of the prevailing morality reflects its interests and its sense of superiority. The moral codes governing relations between Spartans and Helots, planters and enslaved people, nobles and commoners, men and women -- all were shaped primarily by the interests of the powerful class. These class-generated sentiments then reinforced themselves, becoming the moral feelings that members of the dominant group applied even among themselves. When a formerly dominant class loses its position, the prevailing moral sentiments often swing to the opposite extreme, expressing resentment of hierarchy rather than any principled reconsideration.","Sometimes their reason—at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, not seldom their antisocial ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their desires or fears for themselves—their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots, between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority.",,"Morality is shaped less by reason than by prejudice, self-interest, and class power. Wherever one group dominates another -- masters over slaves, men over women, nobles over commoners -- the ruling morality reflects the rulers' interests. And when hierarchies collapse, resentment replaces principle, not justice.","Prevailing moral rules are typically shaped by prejudice, self-interest, and the interests of dominant classes rather than by reason. When power shifts, moral norms often reverse direction without becoming more principled.",Most of what societies call morality is class interest dressed in the language of virtue.,1,12,,,,,"Spartans and Helots -- The Helots were a subjugated population in ancient Sparta (c. 7th century BCE onward), essentially state-owned serfs. Spartan morality sanctioned extreme violence against them, including ritual declarations of war that made killing Helots legally permissible.

Planters and negroes -- Mill refers to chattel slavery in the Americas. The Slavery Abolition Act (1833) had ended slavery in the British Empire, but American slavery persisted until the 13th Amendment (1865), six years after On Liberty was published.

Nobles and roturiers -- 'Roturiers' refers to non-noble commoners in the French feudal system.

Mill's analysis of morality as a product of class interest anticipates Marx and Engels's argument in The German Ideology (1846) and The Communist Manifesto (1848) that 'the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.' Mill was aware of socialist thought but arrived at this observation from a liberal rather than a materialist framework."
1.13,914,660,72%,"Another powerful source of moral customs has been deference to authority -- whether temporal rulers or gods. This servility is not hypocrisy; it produces genuine feelings of moral revulsion. It led communities to burn alleged witches and execute heretics with sincere conviction.

The genuine interests of society have, of course, also played a role in shaping moral sentiment -- but less through rational consideration than through the sympathies and hostilities those interests generated. And sentiments with little connection to society's real interests have shaped moral rules with equal force.","Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters, or of their gods. This servility, though essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians and heretics. Among so many baser influences, the general and obvious interests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in the direction of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason, and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great force.",,"Deference to earthly and divine authority has shaped morality as powerfully as class interest. This servility is not cynical -- it generates sincere moral feeling. It made people burn witches and heretics in good conscience. The real interests of society have influenced morality too, but less through reason than through the passions those interests aroused.","Deference to rulers and religious authority has been a major source of moral rules, producing genuine but often destructive convictions. Society's actual interests have shaped morality less through reason than through the emotions they generate.",Obedience to authority produces genuine moral feeling -- which is precisely what makes it dangerous.,1,13,,,,,"Burning magicians and heretics -- Mill references the European witch trials (c. 15th-18th centuries), which resulted in an estimated 40,000-60,000 executions, and the Inquisition's prosecution of heresy. The Spanish Inquisition (established 1478) and the burning of figures like Giordano Bruno (1600) and the persecution of Galileo (1633) are representative examples.

Odium theologicum -- Mill uses this Latin phrase (theological hatred) later in the chapter. It refers to the peculiar intensity of hostility generated by religious disagreement.

The distinction between morality arising from society's genuine interests versus from 'sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society' is central to Mill's utilitarian critique. He argues that moral rules should be grounded in demonstrable consequences for human welfare, not in inherited emotional reactions."
1.14,3120,1787,57%,"The preferences and aversions of society -- or its most powerful faction -- have thus been the primary force determining what rules are imposed on everyone. Even forward-thinking reformers have rarely challenged the deeper assumption that collective feeling should govern individual conduct. Instead of defending a general right to differ, they have focused on persuading society to adjust the specific customs they personally oppose. They seek to refine particular norms, not to question whether social feeling should function as law over individuals at all.

Religion is the one major exception. Only in matters of faith have people defended, on principle, the individual's right to dissent from the majority. And this defense emerged not from philosophical conviction but from practical necessity: after prolonged conflict among sects, none achieved dominance, and minorities with no prospect of becoming majorities were forced to argue for the freedom to differ. The great advocates of religious liberty asserted freedom of conscience as an absolute right and denied that anyone is accountable to others for their beliefs.

Yet even this hard-won tolerance remains fragile. Genuine religious freedom has been realized in practice mainly where religious indifference keeps the peace, not where deep conviction prevails. In the minds of most religious people, even in tolerant countries, acceptance of dissent comes with tacit limits. One person tolerates disagreement on church governance but not doctrine; another accepts everyone except Catholics or atheists; another draws the line at belief in God. Wherever the majority's conviction remains intense, its expectation of obedience scarcely diminishes.","The likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules laid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or opinion. And in general, those who have been in advance of society in thought and feeling, have left this condition of things unassailed in principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of its details. They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what things society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals. They preferred endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common cause in defence of freedom, with heretics generally. The only case in which the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of religious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called the moral sense: for the
odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. Those who first broke the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church, were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself. But when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a complete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom they could not convert, for permission to differ. It is accordingly on this battle field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted. The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religious belief. Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practically realized, except where religious indifference, which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has added its weight to the scale. In the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in matters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate everybody, short of a Papist or an Unitarian; another, every one who believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.",,"Even progressive reformers rarely challenge the assumption that collective feeling should rule individual conduct. They try to change which feelings prevail, not whether feelings should govern at all. Religion alone forced the question of principle -- and only because no sect could achieve total victory. Minorities argued for tolerance out of necessity, not philosophy. Yet even religious freedom has been fully realized only where indifference, not conviction, keeps the peace. Wherever belief runs deep, tolerance runs shallow.","Reformers typically try to change society's specific preferences rather than questioning whether collective feeling should govern individuals at all. Religious liberty is the one area where the right to dissent has been defended on principle, but only because sectarian stalemate forced it. Even so, genuine tolerance remains rare where strong conviction exists.",Tolerance has been won not by principle but by stalemate -- and it lasts only as long as no faction feels strong enough to impose its will.,1,14,,,,,"The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses -- Mill likely has in mind John Locke (A Letter Concerning Toleration, 1689), Pierre Bayle (Philosophical Commentary, 1686), and Voltaire (Treatise on Tolerance, 1763).

The Universal Church -- The Roman Catholic Church before the Reformation. The Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther (1517), broke its monopoly on Western Christianity.

Mill's observation that Protestant reformers 'were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself' references figures like John Calvin, whose theocratic governance of Geneva included the execution of Michael Servetus for heresy (1553).

Papist or Unitarian -- Catholics ('Papists') were subject to legal disabilities in England until Catholic Emancipation (1829). Unitarians, who denied the Trinity, were excluded from the Toleration Act of 1689 and faced legal penalties until 1813.

Odium theologicum -- Latin: theological hatred. The intense hostility generated by religious disagreement, which Mill calls 'one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling,' illustrating how sincere moral conviction can produce persecution."
1.15,2472,931,38%,"In practice, no society has developed a clear, consistent principle for deciding when government should intervene in individual conduct. People resist or welcome interference based on habit, temperament, or personal interest -- not on any reasoned standard. Some call for government action whenever they see a social problem to be solved. Others would rather endure significant harm than expand the reach of state authority. In each case, the position depends less on principle than on sentiment, convenience, or trust in how the government would act.

England illustrates this confusion. Legal interference with private conduct has historically been lighter there than in most of Europe -- but not because of any principled commitment to individual independence. Rather, the English have retained an older habit of viewing government as an opposing interest, a holdover from the era before democratic accountability. This instinct, though often salutary, is applied with little discrimination: it resists government control as reflexively in areas where regulation is warranted as in areas where it is not.

Because no shared principle guides these judgments, government interference is as often demanded where it is unwarranted as condemned where it is justified.","In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history, though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter, than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the public. The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government their power, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so, individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particular instances of its application. There is, in fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is customarily tested. People decide according to their personal preferences. Some, whenever they see any good to be done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human interests amenable to governmental control. And men range themselves on one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere, as to what things are fit to be done by a government. And it seems to me that in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly condemned.",,"No society has a principled standard for when government should intervene. People invoke or resist state power based on habit and sentiment, not reason. Some want government to solve every problem; others would endure any evil rather than expand its reach. Without a guiding principle, interference is as often wrong when demanded as when refused.","Societies lack a consistent principle for determining when government intervention is justified. People's positions depend on habit, temperament, and self-interest rather than reasoned standards, leading to intervention being both wrongly demanded and wrongly refused with equal frequency.","Without a principle to guide it, every call for government action and every resistance to it is equally arbitrary.",1,15,,,,,"Mill's description of England's lighter legal interference reflects the common-law tradition's emphasis on individual rights and its historical suspicion of continental-style administrative regulation.

The English habit of viewing government as 'representing an opposite interest to the public' is a legacy of the long constitutional struggle between Crown and Parliament, from the Magna Carta through the English Civil War (1642-1651) and the Glorious Revolution (1688).

Mill's warning that 'when they do so' -- when the majority learns to feel the government's power as their own -- 'individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government, as it already is from public opinion' is a predictive argument about the trajectory of democratic governance.

The passage implicitly critiques both laissez-faire liberalism (which resists all intervention) and what Mill elsewhere calls 'paternal government' (which intervenes paternalistically), arguing that both positions are adopted without principled foundation."
1.16,1488,1029,69%,"The purpose of this essay is to defend one principle that should govern every exercise of authority over the individual, whether that authority takes the form of legal penalties, physical force, or social pressure.

The principle is this: the only legitimate reason to interfere with any person's liberty is to prevent harm to others.

A person's own good -- physical, moral, or spiritual -- is never a sufficient justification for coercion. No one may be compelled to act, or prevented from acting, because others believe it would benefit them, make them happier, or be wiser or more virtuous. Such considerations are excellent reasons to advise, persuade, or appeal -- but never to compel. Coercion is justified only when the conduct in question threatens genuine harm to someone other than the person acting.

The individual is accountable to society only for actions that affect others. In everything that concerns only themselves, their freedom is absolute. Over their own body and mind, each person is sovereign.","The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.",,"One principle should govern all authority over the individual: power may be exercised over a person, against their will, only to prevent harm to others. Not for their own good. Not because others think them foolish or wrong. You may advise, persuade, implore -- but you may not compel.

A person's own good is never sufficient reason for coercion. In matters concerning only themselves, the individual is sovereign.",The only legitimate reason to restrict anyone's freedom is to prevent harm to others -- never for their own good.,1,16,,,,,"This passage states what has come to be known as the Harm Principle, Mill's most influential contribution to political philosophy.

The distinction between legitimate persuasion and illegitimate compulsion is central to Mill's liberalism. It draws a line between social influence (acceptable) and social coercion (requiring justification).

'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' -- This claim of individual sovereignty has been invoked in countless legal and philosophical contexts, from arguments for bodily autonomy and reproductive rights to drug decriminalization and the right to die.

Mill's principle builds on but goes beyond earlier liberal thinkers. Locke grounded rights in natural law; Mill grounds them in utility -- specifically, in the long-term interests of humanity as 'progressive beings' (which he will elaborate shortly).

The phrase 'self-regarding conduct' (conduct concerning only oneself) became a term of art in political philosophy. The question of whether truly self-regarding conduct exists -- whether any action affects only the actor -- has been the most persistent objection to Mill's principle."
1.17,1706,1378,81%,"This principle applies only to adults in full possession of their faculties. Children, and those not yet capable of directing their own lives, must be protected not only from external harm but from the consequences of their own actions.

The same exception applies to societies in an early stage of development. Where the obstacles to progress are immense and self-directed improvement not yet possible, rulers may be justified in using extraordinary means to achieve otherwise unattainable ends. In such conditions, a benevolent despotism can be legitimate -- if its genuine purpose is the improvement of the population and its methods actually achieve that aim. Liberty as a governing principle becomes relevant only once people have developed the capacity to benefit from free and equal discussion.

But once a society has reached that stage -- a condition long since achieved in all the communities this essay addresses -- compulsion can no longer be justified for a person's own good. Interference is warranted only to protect others from harm.","It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others.",,"This principle applies only to capable adults, not to children or to societies too early in development for free discussion to be effective. In such cases, benevolent authority may be justified. But once a people can reason and persuade, compulsion for their own good loses all legitimacy. Only the protection of others warrants it.","The harm principle applies only to mature adults and developed societies. Children, dependents, and societies not yet capable of benefiting from free discussion may require paternalistic authority. Once that capacity exists, compulsion is justified only to prevent harm to others.",Liberty as a principle applies only where people are capable of being improved by discussion rather than by command.,1,17,,,,,"Akbar (1542-1605) -- Mughal Emperor of India, known for religious tolerance and administrative reform. Mill cites him as an example of a benevolent despot who advanced his people's development.

Charlemagne (742-814) -- King of the Franks and first Holy Roman Emperor, who unified much of Western Europe and promoted education and cultural revival (the Carolingian Renaissance).

Mill's argument that 'despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians' has been his most criticized claim. Postcolonial scholars, notably Edward Said (Orientalism, 1978), have identified this passage as providing intellectual justification for European colonialism. Mill himself worked for the British East India Company for 35 years (1823-1858), and his views on colonial governance were shaped by that experience.

The concept of 'nonage' (minority, immaturity) echoes Kant's famous definition of Enlightenment as 'the exit of man from his self-incurred nonage' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784), though Mill applies it to entire societies rather than to individuals.

The criterion of being 'capable of being improved by free and equal discussion' sets a threshold for when liberal principles apply -- a threshold Mill believes all 'civilized' nations have passed."
1.18,2775,1611,58%,"I do not ground this argument in abstract natural rights, independent of consequences. Utility is the ultimate standard in all ethical questions -- but utility understood in the broadest sense: the long-term interests of human beings as progressive, developing creatures.

Those interests authorize restricting individual freedom only where a person's actions affect others. When someone causes harm to others, there is a clear case for accountability -- through law, or where law is unsuitable, through social disapproval. Certain positive obligations may also be rightfully enforced: giving testimony in court, contributing to common defense, and performing obvious duties of rescue, such as saving a life when doing so is clearly possible.

A person may cause harm through inaction as well as action, and in either case may be held accountable. But compulsion for failure to act requires far greater caution. Holding someone responsible for causing harm is the rule; holding them responsible for failing to prevent it is the exception -- though at times a necessary one.

Where enforcement would do more harm than good, or where an individual is likely to act better when left to their own judgment, society may rightly refrain from imposing accountability. But these are practical considerations, not denials of society's authority. And where external accountability cannot apply, the individual's own conscience must fill the role -- judging more strictly precisely because no public judgment is possible.","It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being. Those interests, I contend, authorize the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others, there is a
primâ facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation. There are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature’s life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man’s duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury. The latter case, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former. To make any one answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable for not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception. In all things which regard the external relations of the individual, he is
de jure amenable to those whose interests are concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector. There are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than those which it would prevent. When such reasons as these preclude the enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures.",,"I claim no abstract natural rights. Utility is the final standard -- but utility in the deepest sense: the permanent interests of humanity as progressive beings. Those interests justify restricting liberty only to prevent harm to others. Harm through inaction can also warrant accountability, though with greater caution. Where society cannot enforce responsibility, conscience must, and should judge more strictly for the absence of external check.","Mill grounds his argument in utility, not natural rights -- but utility understood as humanity's long-term developmental interests. These justify restricting freedom only where actions affect others. Accountability for inaction is sometimes warranted but requires greater caution. Where enforcement is impractical, individual conscience must substitute.","Utility, not abstract rights, justifies the harm principle -- and utility means the permanent interests of humanity as progressive beings.",1,18,,,,,"Mill's explicit rejection of 'abstract right, as a thing independent of utility' distances him from the natural-rights tradition of Locke and from the Rights of Man tradition of Thomas Paine (1791). It also distinguishes his position from Kant's deontological ethics, which grounds rights in pure practical reason rather than consequences.

'Utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being' -- This is Mill's most important qualification of utilitarianism. It is not about maximizing momentary pleasure but about protecting the conditions under which human beings develop their capacities over time. This connects to his arguments in Utilitarianism (1863) about higher and lower pleasures.

Prima facie -- Latin: at first appearance. A legal term meaning 'sufficient to establish a fact unless rebutted.'

De jure -- Latin: by right, according to law.

The positive obligations Mill lists (testimony, common defense, rescue) represent limits to the libertarian reading of his harm principle. He explicitly affirms that liberty does not mean freedom from all obligation -- only from obligations that serve no one's interests but the individual's own.

The passage about conscience substituting for external accountability reflects Mill's broader moral psychology: the internalized 'sanction' of conscience is, in his utilitarian framework, a feeling of guilt or duty that has been cultivated through education and experience."
1.19,1856,1143,62%,"There is, however, a sphere of life in which society has at most an indirect interest: everything a person does that affects only themselves, or affects others only with their free, informed, and voluntary consent.

This is the proper domain of individual liberty, and it comprises three elements.

First, freedom of thought and conscience in the fullest sense: the liberty to hold any opinion or belief on any subject -- practical, scientific, moral, or theological. Inseparable from this is freedom of expression. Though speech and publication involve others, the liberty to voice and share one's views is so closely linked to the liberty to hold them that the two stand or fall together.

Second, freedom of tastes and pursuits: the liberty to shape one's own life according to one's own character, to do as one judges best, so long as no one else is harmed -- even when others consider one's choices foolish, perverse, or wrong.

Third, the freedom to associate. If individuals are free to think and to live as they choose, it follows that they are free to combine with others for any purpose that does not harm those outside the association, provided all participants act willingly and without deception.","But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending all that portion of a person’s life and conduct which affects only himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation. When I say only himself, I mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself; and the objection which may be grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel. This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow: without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining being supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived.",,"Where conduct affects only the individual, or others only with their free consent, liberty is absolute. It has three dimensions: freedom of thought and expression, which are inseparable; freedom to live according to one's own character without interference; and freedom to associate with others for any harmless purpose. Together, these define what it means for a society to be free.","Individual liberty covers three domains: freedom of thought and expression, freedom to shape one's own life, and freedom of voluntary association. These apply to all conduct that affects only the individual or others only with their free consent.","Liberty means freedom of thought, freedom to live as you choose, and freedom to associate -- in everything that harms no one else.",1,19,,,,,"Mill's three-part taxonomy of liberty -- thought/expression, lifestyle/pursuits, and association -- has become foundational to liberal political theory and constitutional law.

The qualification 'free, voluntary, and undeceived consent' is significant. Mill does not simply say 'consent' but specifies that it must be informed and uncoerced, anticipating modern concerns about manipulation, fraud, and power imbalances in consensual relationships.

Mill's acknowledgment that 'whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself' signals his awareness of the most common objection to his principle. The question of whether truly self-regarding conduct exists has generated centuries of debate. Mill promises to address this 'in the sequel' -- primarily in Chapter IV of On Liberty.

Freedom of expression 'may seem to fall under a different principle' because speech has effects on others. Mill's argument for treating it as inseparable from freedom of thought anticipates the modern legal doctrine that expression is protected not primarily for the speaker's sake but because the free exchange of ideas serves the public interest (a rationale later developed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his 'marketplace of ideas' metaphor, Abrams v. United States, 1919)."

In practice, later chapters introduce nuances and exceptions, but the rhetorical force here is deliberate: Mill wants to establish the presumption in favor of liberty as the default, with any restriction requiring justification.

'Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual' -- This assertion of individual sovereignty over one's own welfare is the philosophical foundation for opposing paternalistic legislation. It has been invoked in debates over drug policy, seatbelt laws, assisted suicide, and personal health choices.

The argument that 'mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves' is both a moral claim and an empirical one. Mill elaborates the empirical case in Chapter III (On Individuality), arguing that diversity of character and lifestyle drives social progress through experimentation and innovation."
1.21,2330,1960,84%,"This principle, though it may sound like a truism, directly opposes the dominant tendency of every era. Societies have always devoted enormous effort to enforcing conformity with prevailing standards of personal conduct -- often more effort than they devote to genuinely social obligations.

In the ancient world, both governments and philosophers considered the state entitled to regulate nearly every aspect of private life, on the grounds that it had a deep interest in the physical and mental discipline of every citizen. In small republics surrounded by powerful enemies and constantly threatened by invasion or civil unrest, this was understandable. Survival seemed to require constant vigilance, and they felt unable to wait for the slower benefits of individual freedom.

In the modern world, larger political communities and the separation of church and state prevented governments from exercising the same legal control over private conduct. But social pressure filled the gap. Moral repression has often been directed more fiercely against personal nonconformity than against genuinely antisocial behavior. Religion, one of the most powerful forces shaping moral sentiment, has been driven either by institutional ambition to govern every aspect of life or by a puritanical impulse toward rigid discipline.

Nor have secular reformers always been more tolerant. Auguste Comte's System of Positive Polity envisioned a moral despotism of society over the individual more extensive than anything imagined by the strictest ancient philosophers -- achieved through social pressure rather than law, but no less totalizing in its ambitions.","Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice. Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselves entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the ground that the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom. In the modern world, the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of men’s consciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the details of private life; but the engines of moral repression have been wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit of Puritanism. And some of those modern reformers who have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past, have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right of spiritual domination: M. Comte, in particular, whose social system, as unfolded in his
Système de Politique Positive, aims at establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism of society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers.",,"This principle sounds obvious. It is anything but. Every society has devoted enormous energy to enforcing conformity in personal conduct. Ancient states regulated private life openly; modern states rely on social pressure instead of law, but the impulse is the same. Religion enforces it through doctrine, puritanism through shame, and even secular reformers like Comte have proposed systems of social control more comprehensive than any ancient philosopher imagined.","Despite sounding obvious, the principle of individual liberty directly opposes the persistent tendency of societies to enforce personal conformity. This tendency has manifested through state regulation in ancient republics, religious moral authority, and even secular reform movements like Comte's positivism.",Every society claims to value individual freedom; every society devotes enormous energy to suppressing it.,1,21,,,,,"Ancient commonwealths -- Mill refers primarily to Sparta and to Plato's Republic, which prescribed detailed regulation of citizens' lives including diet, exercise, education, sexual conduct, and artistic expression.

The separation between spiritual and temporal authority -- The investiture controversy (11th-12th centuries) and the gradual separation of church and state that followed the Reformation. This separation, Mill argues, paradoxically reduced legal control over private life while increasing informal social control.

Puritanism -- Both the historical Puritan movement (16th-17th centuries) and the broader cultural tendency toward moral rigorism. Mill saw Puritan influence as particularly strong in Victorian England and in New England.

Auguste Comte (1798-1857) -- French philosopher, founder of positivism and sociology. His Systeme de Politique Positive (1851-1854) proposed a 'Religion of Humanity' with detailed prescriptions for personal conduct enforced through social opinion. Mill initially admired Comte but became increasingly critical, publishing Auguste Comte and Positivism (1865) partly to distance himself.

Mill's comparison of Comte to 'the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers' likely refers to Plato and to the Stoics, whose philosophy prescribed detailed regulation of personal life in pursuit of virtue."
1.22,1048,723,69%,"Beyond the theories of individual thinkers, there is a broad and growing tendency worldwide to expand society's power over the individual, through both public opinion and law. Every major development in the modern world strengthens collective institutions while weakening individual resistance. This encroachment will not reverse itself; it is likely to intensify.

The impulse to impose one's own opinions and preferences on others is one of the deepest features of human nature, fueled equally by compassion and by contempt, by moral conviction and by tribal instinct. It is restrained only when people lack the power to act on it. As society's collective power grows, only a strong moral conviction in favor of individual liberty can check its expansion. Without that conviction, the pressure toward conformity will continue to increase.","Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens, to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase.",,"The tendency to extend society's power over individuals is growing, not shrinking. Every modern development strengthens collective institutions and weakens individual resistance. The impulse to impose one's views on others is restrained only by lack of power -- and power is not declining. Without a strong moral conviction in favor of liberty, conformity will tighten its grip.","Society's power over individuals is growing through both opinion and law, and modern developments reinforce this trend. The human impulse to impose conformity is checked only by lack of power, and that power is increasing. Only a firm moral commitment to individual liberty can resist this trajectory.","The impulse to impose conformity is checked only by lack of power -- and society's power is growing, not shrinking.",1,22,,,,,"Mill's warning about the growing power of society over individuals anticipates several major developments: the expansion of the administrative state in the late 19th and 20th centuries, the rise of mass media and its capacity to enforce cultural conformity, and the emergence of totalitarian regimes that claimed to express the people's will.

'Supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature' -- Mill recognizes that the impulse to control others is not simply malicious. It is often motivated by genuine concern for others' welfare (paternalism) or by sincere moral conviction, which makes it harder to resist than purely self-interested tyranny.

Mill's prediction that encroachment on liberty would grow 'more and more formidable' has been validated by developments he could not have foreseen: digital surveillance, algorithmic content moderation, social media mob dynamics, and the capacity of modern states and corporations to monitor and influence individual behavior at unprecedented scale.

The call for 'a strong barrier of moral conviction' reflects Mill's belief that institutional safeguards alone are insufficient. Liberty requires a culture that values it -- a point he develops throughout the remainder of On Liberty."

These freedoms are acknowledged, to some degree, in every society that claims to support free institutions and religious tolerance. Yet the philosophical and practical reasons that justify them are less widely understood than one might expect, even among prominent public voices.

A careful examination of this single branch of liberty will provide the strongest foundation for understanding the rest.

Although these liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might have been expected. Those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the best introduction to the remainder.

By starting with the most widely accepted form of liberty, he can establish principles that he will then extend to more controversial domains (individuality, lifestyle choices, limits of social authority) in later chapters.

'For now three centuries' -- Mill dates the debate over freedom of thought and expression to the Reformation era (early 16th century), when the printing press and Protestant challenges to Catholic authority made censorship and free expression central political issues.

Key figures in the three-century tradition Mill references include: John Milton (Areopagitica, 1644), the first major English-language argument against censorship; John Locke (A Letter Concerning Toleration, 1689); Voltaire (Letters on the English, 1733; Treatise on Tolerance, 1763); and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison (the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified 1791).

Mill's Chapter II (Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion) became one of the most influential defenses of free expression ever written, providing arguments still cited in legal decisions and philosophical debates about censorship, hate speech, and the limits of permissible discourse."

2.1,1729,136,8%,"The case for press freedom against tyrannical government has been made so thoroughly by earlier writers that it hardly needs restating. Even in England, where press laws technically remain as restrictive as under the Tudors, the real risk of government censorship of political speech is minimal -- except in moments of collective panic, when fear overrides principle. In functioning democracies, government rarely tries to suppress opinion on its own initiative. When it does, it acts as an instrument of something more dangerous: the intolerance of the public itself.

So let us set aside the easy case of a government opposed to its people. Suppose instead a government perfectly aligned with popular will, suppressing only what the majority wants suppressed. I deny its right to do so. That power is illegitimate no matter who wields it. The best government has no more title to silence dissent than the worst. Coercion of opinion is most dangerous precisely when it reflects popular sentiment -- because then it faces the least resistance.","THE TIME, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would be necessary of the “liberty of the press” as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government. No argument, we may suppose, can now be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to hear. This aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it needs not be specially insisted on in this place. Though the law of England, on the subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of the Tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force against political discussion, except during some temporary panic, when fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from their propriety;
*1 and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional countries, to be apprehended, that the government, whether completely responsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control the expression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ of the general intolerance of the public. Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it.",,"The old battle was against governments that silenced dissent. The new battle is harder: against a public that demands the silencing, and a government happy to oblige. Censorship backed by popular will is not more legitimate than censorship imposed against it.

The greater threat is the coercion of opinion by the public itself, which is illegitimate regardless of majority support.","Censorship is most dangerous not when imposed by tyrants against the people, but when demanded by the people themselves.",2,1,,,,,"[Tudor-era press censorship] (1485-1603) -- England's historically restrictive press laws dating to the Star Chamber and licensing acts.

This is not about protecting individual feelings. If an opinion were merely a personal possession -- like a taste in music or food -- then suppressing it would be a private injury, and scale would matter. But silencing an opinion is something far worse: it robs the entire human race, present and future. If the suppressed opinion is right, everyone loses the chance to replace error with truth. If it is wrong, everyone loses something nearly as valuable -- the sharper, more vital understanding of truth that comes only from its collision with error.","If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it.

2.4,2902,1839,63%,"Start with the first possibility: the opinion being suppressed might actually be true. Its suppressors naturally deny this -- but they are not infallible. No one has the authority to decide a question for all of humanity and deny everyone else the means of judging. To silence an opinion because you are sure it is false is to treat your certainty as absolute certainty. All censorship rests on an assumption of infallibility.

Everyone acknowledges their own fallibility in theory. Almost no one acts on it. People rarely consider that the beliefs they hold most confidently might be among the errors they admit they are prone to. Those accustomed to power and deference -- rulers, executives, public figures -- feel this unwarranted confidence most acutely. But even ordinary people display a version of it: they simply outsource their certainty to their social circle. ""The world"" to most people means their party, their demographic, their media ecosystem, their nation at most. And this confidence is rarely shaken by the obvious fact that people in other circles, other countries, other centuries hold or held the exact opposite views with equal conviction.

The same accident of birth that makes someone a political conservative in Texas would have made them a communist in Soviet Moscow or a Buddhist in Lhasa. Yet people treat the worldview they inherited as if it were arrived at by rigorous reasoning. Entire eras are no more infallible than individuals. Every age has held beliefs that later generations found not merely false but absurd. It is certain that some of our own confident beliefs will meet the same fate.","First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that
their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common.

Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. Absolute princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all subjects. People more happily situated, who sometimes hear their opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they habitually defer: for in proportion to a man’s want of confidence in his own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of “the world” in general. And the world, to each individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his party, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age. Nor is his faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, and even now think, the exact reverse. He devolves upon his own world the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient worlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance, and that the same causes which make him a Churchman in London, would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Pekin. Yet it is as evident in itself, as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no more infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as certain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present.",,"To silence a view because you are certain it is false is to equate your certainty with infallibility.

2.5,2181,0,0%,"The obvious rebuttal goes like this: Governments and institutions must act on their best judgment every day. They set policy, allocate resources, make war and peace -- all based on opinions that might be wrong. If the possibility of error paralyzed all action, nothing would ever get done. A government that believes an opinion is dangerous has a duty to act on that belief, just as it has a duty to act on any other policy judgment. The fact that past governments have been wrong about some opinions does not mean present governments should never act against any opinions -- just as the fact that governments have waged unjust wars does not mean they should never wage war at all.

On this view, demanding absolute certainty before acting is not conscience but cowardice. We cannot achieve perfect certainty about anything. But we can reach sufficient confidence for practical decisions. We assume our opinions are true enough to guide our own conduct; why not also true enough to prevent others from spreading what we sincerely believe to be dangerous falsehoods?","The objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take some such form as the following. There is no greater assumption of infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any other thing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and responsibility. Judgment is given to men that they may use it. Because it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to use it at all? To prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them, although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. If we were never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong, we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties unperformed. An objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid objection to any conduct in particular. It is the duty of governments, and of individuals, to form the truest opinions they can; to form them carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure of being right. But when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scattered abroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightened times, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true. Let us take care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments and nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be fit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad taxes, made unjust wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under whatever provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must act to the best of their ability. There is no such thing as absolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life. We may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and pernicious.",,"The counterargument sounds practical: governments must act under uncertainty in every domain, so why should opinion be exempt?

The only thing that can justify acting on a belief is that it has survived open, unrestricted challenge. Without that, no human being can claim rational confidence in being right.

Raw experience does not interpret itself. Facts need argument to extract their meaning.

The entire value of human judgment depends on this one property: that it can be corrected when wrong. And it can only be corrected if the means of correction -- open criticism, opposing argument, diverse perspectives -- remain constantly available.

Look at any person whose judgment genuinely deserves trust. How did they earn it? By keeping their mind open to criticism. By making it a practice to hear everything that could be said against their position. By engaging seriously with people who see the world differently.

Having heard the strongest objections and answered them, having let in every available light on the question, such a person has earned the right to trust their judgment -- more than any person or any crowd that has not done the same work.","When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other are no worse than they are? Not certainly to the inherent force of the human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative; for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things which no one will now justify. Why is it, then, that there is on the whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct? If there really is this preponderance—which there must be unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate state—it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it. Very few facts are able to tell their own story, without comments to bring out their meaning. The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious. Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in the nature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner. The steady habit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it: for, being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him, and having taken up his position against all gainsayers—knowing that he has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them, and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject from any quarter—he has a right to think his judgment better than that of any person, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process.",,"Human judgment has exactly one virtue: it can be corrected. Remove the means of correction -- open challenge, honest criticism, opposing perspectives -- and that virtue dies. The wisest people are not those born with superior insight but those who have made a discipline of hearing every argument against them. Certainty earned through confrontation is the only certainty worth having.","Human progress depends not on innate reasoning ability but on the capacity to correct errors through discussion.

If the principle does not hold in extreme cases, it does not hold at all.

2.10,3231,0,0%,"In our era -- anxious rather than faithful, clinging to beliefs not because they are true but because people would not know how to function without them -- the case for protecting opinions from attack shifts from truth to utility. The argument becomes: some beliefs are so essential to social stability that governments have a duty to uphold them, just as they protect any other vital public interest. You do not need to be infallible to recognize a load-bearing wall.

This looks like a clever escape from the infallibility problem, but it is not. Shifting from ""this belief is true"" to ""this belief is useful"" merely relocates the assumption. Whether an opinion is useful is itself an opinion -- just as debatable, just as requiring of open discussion, as the original claim. You still need an infallible judge to declare a belief harmful unless the belief has full opportunity to defend itself.

And the truth-utility distinction collapses under scrutiny. You cannot fairly assess whether a belief is useful without asking whether it is true. Truth is part of utility. The best minds in every era have held that no false belief can ultimately serve society well. You cannot forbid people from defending the truth of their opinions while allowing them to argue only about usefulness -- the two are inseparable. In practice, when a society prohibits questioning a belief's truth, it equally refuses to tolerate questioning its usefulness. The most it permits is quibbling about how strictly the belief must be enforced.","In the present age—which has been described as “destitute of faith, but terrified at scepticism”—in which people feel sure, not so much that their opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do without them—the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack are rested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society. There are, it is alleged, certain beliefs, so useful, not to say indispensable to well-being, that it is as much the duty of governments to uphold those beliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society. In a case of such necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty, something less than infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and even bind, governments, to act on their own opinion, confirmed by the general opinion of mankind. It is also often argued, and still oftener thought, that none but bad men would desire to weaken these salutary beliefs; and there can be nothing wrong, it is thought, in restraining bad men, and prohibiting what only such men would wish to practise. This mode of thinking makes the justification of restraints on discussion not a question of the truth of doctrines, but of their usefulness; and flatters itself by that means to escape the responsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opinions. But those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the assumption of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another. The usefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, as open to discussion, and requiring discussion as much, as the opinion itself. There is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to decide an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. And it will not do to say that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or harmlessness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth. The truth of an opinion is part of its utility. If we would know whether or not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed, is it possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true? In the opinion, not of bad men, but of the best men, no belief which is contrary to truth can be really useful: and can you prevent such men from urging that plea, when they are charged with culpability for denying some doctrine which they are told is useful, but which they believe to be false? Those who are on the side of received opinions, never fail to take all possible advantage of this plea; you do not find
them handling the question of utility as if it could be completely abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is, above all, because their doctrine is the “truth,” that the knowledge or the belief of it is held to be so indispensable. There can be no fair discussion of the question of usefulness, when an argument so vital may be employed on one side, but not on the other. And in point of fact, when law or public feeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed, they are just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness. The utmost they allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positive guilt of rejecting it.",,"Defending censorship on grounds of utility instead of truth merely relocates the problem.

2.11,2478,0,0%,"To make this argument concrete, take the hardest possible case -- the one most unfavorable to my position. Let the belief in question be the existence of God, the afterlife, or fundamental moral principles. If any beliefs deserve legal protection from challenge, surely these do.

But I must clarify what I mean. Feeling certain about a belief -- however certain -- is not what I call an assumption of infallibility. The assumption of infallibility is deciding the question for others: preventing them from hearing the opposing case and judging for themselves. I condemn this equally when it is done in defense of beliefs I hold most deeply.

And far from being less dangerous when applied to beliefs labeled sacred or immoral to question, this is precisely where the assumption of infallibility does the most damage. These are the cases where one generation commits errors that fill later generations with horror. These are the occasions when legal authority has been used to destroy the best people and the most vital ideas -- sometimes successfully destroying the people while the ideas survive, only to be invoked, with bitter irony, to justify the same treatment of the next generation of dissenters.","In order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to opinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, it will be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and I choose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me—in which the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score of truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief in a God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality. To fight the battle on such ground, gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he will be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say it internally), Are these the doctrines which you do not deem sufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of law? Is the belief in a God one of the opinions, to feel sure of which, you hold to be assuming infallibility? But I must be permitted to observe, that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question
for others, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However positive any one’s persuasion may be, not only of the falsity but of the pernicious consequences—not only of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment, though backed by the public judgment of his country or his cotemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal. These are exactly the occasions on which the men of one generation commit those dreadful mistakes, which excite the astonishment and horror of posterity. It is among such that we find the instances memorable in history, when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the best men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to the men, though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mockery) invoked, in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from
them, or from their received interpretation.",,"Take the hardest case: belief in God, the afterlife, fundamental morality. If anything deserves protection from challenge, these do.

A man whose moral example left such an impression on those who witnessed his life that eighteen centuries later, much of the world reveres him as God incarnate -- was executed as a blasphemer. His contemporaries did not merely fail to recognize their benefactor. They classified him as the precise opposite of what he was and punished him accordingly.

But here is what most people get wrong about these events: the men who condemned Jesus were not unusually wicked. They were ordinary people with the standard religious and patriotic feelings of their time -- the kind of respectable, conscientious citizens who in any era, including ours, live blameless and honored lives. The high priest who tore his garments at what he genuinely perceived as the blackest blasphemy was almost certainly as sincere in his horror as any devout person today is in their moral convictions. Most people who now recoil at his actions would, had they been born into his world, have done exactly the same thing.

The man who left on the memory of those who witnessed his life and conversation, such an impression of his moral grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to him as the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death, as what? As a blasphemer. Men did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mistook him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as that prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held to be, for their treatment of him.

The high-priest who rent his garments when the words were pronounced, which, according to all the ideas of his country, constituted the blackest guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his horror and indignation, as the generality of respectable and pious men now are in the religious and moral sentiments they profess; and most of those who now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his time, and been born Jews, would have acted precisely as he did.

2.14,3622,0,0%,"Now consider the most striking case of all -- where the error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of the person who commits it.

Marcus Aurelius was the absolute ruler of the civilized world, and by all accounts one of the finest human beings ever to hold power. A Stoic philosopher whose personal writings remain among the highest achievements of ancient ethical thought, he governed with unblemished justice and, despite his austere training, remarkable compassion. His moral vision was so close to Christianity's that he could fairly be called a better Christian -- in every sense except the doctrinal one -- than almost any Christian sovereign who followed him.

And yet Marcus Aurelius persecuted Christians. He saw Roman society as fragile, held together by traditional religious bonds. Christianity openly aimed to dissolve those bonds. Unless he was prepared to adopt the new religion himself -- and its theological claims struck him as incredible -- he felt duty-bound to suppress it. His reasoning was identical to the reasoning used by every subsequent defender of religious persecution: this doctrine threatens the social fabric, and as ruler, I must protect it.

This is one of history's great tragedies. Had Christianity become the state religion under Marcus Aurelius rather than Constantine, its character might have been profoundly different. But it would be dishonest to deny that every argument ever used to justify punishing anti-Christian speech was equally available to Marcus Aurelius for punishing Christianity itself.

Unless you believe you are wiser and more virtuous than Marcus Aurelius -- more intellectually honest, more devoted to truth -- you should not assume the right to suppress opinions you find dangerous. He made that assumption, and history judged him wrong.","Let us add one more example, the most striking of all, if the impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him who falls into it. If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his cotemporaries, it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ. This man, a better Christian in all but the dogmatic sense of the word, than almost any of the ostensibly Christian sovereigns who have since reigned, persecuted Christianity. Placed at the summit of all the previous attainments of humanity, with an open, unfettered intellect, and a character which led him of himself to embody in his moral writings the Christian ideal, he yet failed to see that Christianity was to be a good and not an evil to the world, with his duties to which he was so deeply penetrated. Existing society he knew to be in a deplorable state. But such as it was, he saw, or thought he saw, that it was held together, and prevented from being worse, by belief and reverence of the received divinities. As a ruler of mankind, he deemed it his duty not to suffer society to fall in pieces; and saw not how, if its existing ties were removed, any others could be formed which could again knit it together. The new religion openly aimed at dissolving these ties: unless, therefore, it was his duty to adopt that religion, it seemed to be his duty to put it down. Inasmuch then as the theology of Christianity did not appear to him true or of divine origin; inasmuch as this strange history of a crucified God was not credible to him, and a system which purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so wholly unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agency which, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gentlest and most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn sense of duty, authorized the persecution of Christianity. To my mind this is one of the most tragical facts in all history. It is a bitter thought, how different a thing the Christianity of the world might have been, if the Christian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under the auspices of Marcus Aurelius instead of those of Constantine. But it would be equally unjust to him and false to truth, to deny, that no one plea which can be urged for punishing anti-Christian teaching, was wanting to Marcus Aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation of Christianity. No Christian more firmly believes that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity; he who, of all men then living, might have been thought the most capable of appreciating it. Unless any one who approves of punishment for the promulgation of opinions, flatters himself that he is a wiser and better man than Marcus Aurelius—more deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated in his intellect above it—more earnest in his search for truth, or more single-minded in his devotion to it when found;—let him abstain from that assumption of the joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the great Antoninus made with so unfortunate a result.",,"Marcus Aurelius -- philosopher-emperor, the most virtuous ruler of the ancient world, a better Christian in practice than almost any Christian king -- persecuted Christianity with the same logic every censor uses: this belief threatens society.

This argument deserves serious examination, because it concedes the key point -- that persecution of ideas is sometimes directed at truth -- while claiming this does not matter because truth is indestructible.","Aware of the impossibility of defending the use of punishment for restraining irreligious opinions, by any argument which will not justify Marcus Antoninus, the enemies of religious freedom, when hard pressed, occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with Dr. Johnson, that the persecutors of Christianity were in the right; that persecution is an ordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes successfully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against truth, though sometimes beneficially effective against mischievous errors.

2.16,1675,0,0%,"A doctrine that says truth may be persecuted because persecution cannot ultimately harm it is not, technically, hostile to new truths. But it shows remarkable indifference to the people who discover them. To reveal something the world urgently needs to know -- to prove that humanity has been wrong on a vital question -- is one of the greatest services any person can render. If you believe, as the proponents of this view must, that the early Christians and the Reformers gave humanity its most precious gifts, then you must also accept that your doctrine consigns these benefactors to martyrdom as the normal cost of progress.

The ancient Locrians had a law: anyone proposing a new rule had to stand before the assembly with a noose around his neck, to be tightened immediately if the proposal was rejected. That is essentially what this argument demands of anyone who brings the world a new truth. People who defend treating their greatest benefactors this way cannot truly value the benefit. This view is typically held by those who believe new truths may once have been necessary -- but that we have had quite enough of them now.","A theory which maintains that truth may justifiably be persecuted because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be charged with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but we cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whom mankind are indebted for them. To discover to the world something which deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to it that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or spiritual interest, is as important a service as a human being can render to his fellow-creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the early Christians and of the Reformers, those who think with Dr. Johnson believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed on mankind. That the authors of such splendid benefits should be requited by martyrdom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as the vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error and misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes, but the normal and justifiable state of things. The propounder of a new truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the legislation of the Locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halter round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly did not, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition. People who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed to set much value on the benefit; and I believe this view of the subject is mostly confined to the sort of persons who think that new truths may have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now.",,"If truth always survives persecution, then martyrdom is just the standard fee for advancing human knowledge.

2.17,2055,0,0%,"The claim that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of those pleasant falsehoods that people repeat until it passes for common sense, while all of history refutes it. The record is full of truths that persecution destroyed -- or at least delayed by centuries.

Look at religious history alone. Movements toward reformation arose at least twenty times before Luther succeeded. Arnold of Brescia was crushed. Fra Dolcino was crushed. Savonarola was crushed. The Albigensians were crushed. The Waldensians were crushed. The Lollards were crushed. The Hussites were crushed. Even after Luther, wherever persecution was sustained with sufficient force, it succeeded. Protestantism was eradicated in Spain, Italy, Flanders, and the Austrian Empire. It would likely have been eradicated in England too, had Queen Mary lived longer or Queen Elizabeth died sooner.

Persecution has always worked unless the persecuted group was simply too large to suppress. Christianity itself might easily have been extinguished in the Roman Empire. It survived not because truth has some magical resilience, but because the persecutions were intermittent -- occasional crackdowns separated by long periods of relatively undisturbed growth.

It is sentimental nonsense to believe that truth, merely by being true, possesses some inherent advantage over falsehood. People fight for error just as passionately as for truth. Sufficient legal or social pressure will stop the spread of either. The only real advantage truth has is this: when suppressed, it tends to be rediscovered. Kill it once, twice, ten times -- eventually someone will arrive at the same insight again. And if that rediscovery happens to occur at a moment when conditions are favorable, it may gain enough ground to survive all subsequent attempts at suppression.","But, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution, is one of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes. History teems with instances of truth put down by persecution. If not suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only of religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times before Luther, and was put down. Arnold of Brescia was put down. Fra Dolcino was put down. Savonarola was put down. The Albigeois were put down. The Vaudois were put down. The Lollards were put down. The Hussites were put down. Even after the era of Luther, wherever persecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy, Flanders, the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most likely, would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen Elizabeth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated in the Roman Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. The real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.",,"Truth always triumphs over persecution -- a pleasant lie that all of history refutes.

2.18,3489,0,0%,"The obvious response: we no longer execute people for their opinions. We build monuments to the prophets our ancestors killed. True enough -- we have moved past burning heretics. The penalties modern sentiment would tolerate are not severe enough to wipe out a belief entirely. But we should not congratulate ourselves on having left persecution behind.

Penalties for opinion still exist in law, and their enforcement is not so rare as to make their revival unthinkable. Consider cases from Mill's own time that have clear modern parallels: a man imprisoned for expressing offensive views about religion; citizens denied the right to serve as jurors because they professed no religious belief; a person denied legal protection -- effectively declared an outlaw -- for being an atheist. The legal assumption was that an oath from someone who did not believe in God was worthless, which is both historically ignorant (many of history's most honorable figures have been nonbelievers) and self-defeating: the rule admits the testimony of every atheist willing to lie about their beliefs while rejecting those honest enough to admit them.

A rule that punishes honesty and rewards deception, that excludes people from legal protection precisely because they demonstrate the integrity that proves them trustworthy, survives only as a badge of hostility -- a relic of persecution. And it insults believers as much as nonbelievers: if atheists are assumed to be liars, the implication is that believers are kept honest only by fear of hell.","It will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of new opinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we even build sepulchres to them. It is true we no longer put heretics to death; and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probably tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient to extirpate them. But let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free from the stain even of legal persecution. Penalties for opinion, or at least for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is not, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible that they may some day be revived in full force. In the year 1857, at the summer assizes of the county of Cornwall, an unfortunate man,
*2 said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, was sentenced to twenty-one months’ imprisonment, for uttering, and writing on a gate, some offensive words concerning Christianity. Within a month of the same time, at the Old Bailey, two persons, on two separate occasions,
*3 were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared that they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner,
*4 for the same reason, was denied justice against a thief. This refusal of redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person can be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not profess belief in a God (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which is equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from the protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions, be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence. The assumption on which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person who does not believe in a future state; a proposition which betokens much ignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it is historically true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have been persons of distinguished integrity and honor); and would be maintained by no one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons in greatest repute with the world, both for virtues and for attainments, are well known, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers. The rule, besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. Under pretence that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who are willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood. A rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed purpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to deserve it. The rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly less insulting to believers than to infidels. For if he who does not believe in a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believe are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear of hell. We will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury of supposing, that the conception which they have formed of Christian virtue is drawn from their own consciousness.",,"We no longer burn heretics, but legal penalties for opinion persist. A rule that rejects the testimony of honest atheists while accepting that of dishonest ones does not protect truth -- it punishes integrity. It survives only as a relic of persecution, and it insults believers as much as it harms nonbelievers: its logic implies that only fear of hell keeps the faithful honest.","Although outright execution for heresy has ended, legal penalties for opinion persist.

2.22,2876,0,0%,"We may no longer kill dissenters, but that does not mean we have stopped doing damage. When Socrates was executed, his philosophy rose and illuminated the world. When Christians were thrown to lions, their church grew into a force that overshadowed everything around it. Outright persecution can create martyrs and fuel movements.

Our modern method of social intolerance is subtler and, in a way, more insidious. It kills no one and roots out no opinions, but it forces people to hide what they think. Dissenting ideas do not blaze out and transform society; they smolder indefinitely in small circles of thinkers, never reaching the wider world. The result is a comfortable intellectual peace -- all prevailing opinions undisturbed on the surface, while dissenters are permitted to think privately as long as they keep quiet publicly.

The price of this peace is the moral courage of the human mind. When the most active and searching intellects learn to keep their real convictions hidden -- saying one thing publicly while believing another privately -- society cannot produce open, fearless, intellectually consistent people. It produces conformists and intellectual cowards. Those who refuse both conformity and cowardice retreat into narrow, practical matters, avoiding the fundamental questions that could actually enlarge the human mind. The very kind of thinking that could make all the practical problems solvable -- bold, free inquiry into foundational principles -- is precisely what gets abandoned.","There is no room for any appeal ad misericordiam in behalf of such persons. But though we do not now inflict so much evil on those who think differently from us, as it was formerly our custom to do, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatment of them. Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose like the sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the whole intellectual firmament. Christians were cast to the lions, but the Christian church grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the older and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade. Our merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, but induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any active effort for their diffusion. With us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or even lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out far and wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the general affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. And thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds, because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning anybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed, while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason by dissentients afflicted with the malady of thought. A convenient plan for having peace in the intellectual world, and keeping all things going on therein very much as they do already. But the price paid for this sort of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the human mind. A state of things in which a large portion of the most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the general principles and grounds of their convictions within their own breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to fit as much as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters, and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world. The sort of men who can be looked for under it, are either mere conformers to commonplace, or time-servers for truth, whose arguments on all great subjects are meant for their hearers, and are not those which have convinced themselves. Those who avoid this alternative, do so by narrowing their thoughts and interest to things which can be spoken of without venturing within the region of principles, that is, to small practical matters, which would come right of themselves, if but the minds of mankind were strengthened and enlarged, and which will never be made effectually right until then: while that which would strengthen and enlarge men’s minds, free and daring speculation on the highest subjects, is abandoned.",,"We no longer create martyrs; we create something worse -- a culture of quiet self-censorship.

An Under-Secretary of State, in a speech delivered to his constituents on the 12th of November, 1857, is reported to have said: “Toleration of their faith” (the faith of a hundred millions of British subjects), “the superstition which they called religion, by the British Government, had had the effect of retarding the ascendancy of the British name, and preventing the salutary growth of Christianity…. Toleration was the great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but do not let them abuse that precious word toleration.” As he understood it, it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship,
among Christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation. It meant toleration of all sects and denominations of
Christians who believed in the one mediation. I desire to call attention to the fact, that a man who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this country, under a liberal Ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who do not believe in the divinity of Christ are beyond the pale of toleration. Who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion that religious persecution has passed away, never to return? [Unclear endpoint for quotation beginning “the superstition which….” Some texts have this quotation ending after “one mediation,” or after “growth of Christianity.” The phrase “As he understood it,” suggests Mill is the speaker at that point.—Econlib Ed.]",,"In the wake of the Indian Rebellion, leading voices declared that toleration meant freedom among Christian sects -- and nothing more. When a senior official in a liberal government can publicly exclude a hundred million subjects from the pale of tolerance, persecution is not a relic. It is dormant.","The British response to the 1857 Indian Rebellion revealed active persecutory sentiment: Evangelical leaders demanded Christian-only education and employment in India, and a government official defined toleration as applying only among Christian denominations.","When a liberal government's own officials define toleration as freedom among Christian sects alone, religious persecution is not history -- it is policy.",2,F5,Footnote,,,,"[Sepoy Rebellion / Indian Rebellion of 1857] -- Major uprising against British East India Company rule, also called the Indian Mutiny.

2.23,3833,0,0%,"Those who see no harm in the silence of heretics should consider two things. First, without open challenge, unsound dissenting ideas are never properly defeated -- they simply persist underground, unexamined and unrefuted. But the greater damage falls not on dissenters but on everyone else. When all inquiry must arrive at orthodox conclusions or face punishment, the minds most harmed are the conventional ones. The fear of heresy cramps mental development and intimidates the intellect of the majority.

Think of the promising minds combined with cautious temperaments -- people capable of original, independent thought who never pursue it because they fear where it might lead. Think of the deeply conscientious thinkers who spend their lives trying to reconcile what their reason tells them with what orthodoxy demands, exhausting their intellectual gifts on an impossible task. No one can be a great thinker without following their intellect wherever it leads. Truth gains more from the honest errors of independent thinkers than from the correct opinions of people who hold them only because they never permitted themselves to think.

But the need for intellectual freedom extends far beyond producing great thinkers. It is equally necessary for ordinary people to reach their full mental capacity. There have been great individual minds under conditions of intellectual repression. But there has never been an intellectually vibrant society under such conditions. Whenever a people has approached genuine intellectual vitality, it has been during a temporary lifting of the prohibition on fundamental questioning.

History offers three clear examples: the period immediately following the Protestant Reformation, the intellectual movement of the late eighteenth century across Continental Europe, and the philosophical ferment of Germany during the era of Goethe and Fichte. These periods differed radically in their specific conclusions but shared one feature: an old mental despotism had been overthrown, and no new one had yet replaced it. The energy released during those three periods made modern Europe what it is. Every significant advance in human thought or institutions can be traced to one of them. And all signs suggest their impulse is now spent. We cannot expect a new intellectual awakening until we reassert our freedom to think.","Those in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil, should consider in the first place, that in consequence of it there is never any fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and that such of them as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be prevented from spreading, do not disappear. But it is not the minds of heretics that are deteriorated most, by the ban placed on all inquiry which does not end in the orthodox conclusions. The greatest harm done is to those who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development is cramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy. Who can compute what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous, independent train of thought, lest it should land them in something which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? Among them we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, and subtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticating with an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources of ingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscience and reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the end succeed in doing. No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think. Not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great thinkers, that freedom of thinking is required. On the contrary, it is as much and even more indispensable, to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature which they are capable of. There have been, and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of mental slavery. But there never has been, nor ever will be, in that atmosphere, an intellectually active people. When any people has made a temporary approach to such a character, it has been because the dread of heterodox speculation was for a time suspended. Where there is a tacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where the discussion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity is considered to be closed, we cannot hope to find that generally high scale of mental activity which has made some periods of history so remarkable. Never when controversy avoided the subjects which are large and important enough to kindle enthusiasm, was the mind of a people stirred up from its foundations, and the impulse given which raised even persons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity of thinking beings. Of such we have had an example in the condition of Europe during the times immediately following the Reformation; another, though limited to the Continent and to a more cultivated class, in the speculative movement of the latter half of the eighteenth century; and a third, of still briefer duration, in the intellectual fermentation of Germany during the Goethian and Fichtean period. These periods differed widely in the particular opinions which they developed; but were alike in this, that during all three the yoke of authority was broken. In each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had yet taken its place. The impulse given at these three periods has made Europe what it now is. Every single improvement which has taken place either in the human mind or in institutions, may be traced distinctly to one or other of them. Appearances have for some time indicated that all three impulses are well nigh spent; and we can expect no fresh start, until we again assert our mental freedom.",,"The worst damage of censorship falls not on dissenters but on everyone else -- on the promising minds that never dare follow their own reasoning, on the conscientious thinkers who exhaust themselves reconciling honesty with orthodoxy. Every intellectual awakening in history has occurred when an old mental despotism was thrown off and no new one had yet replaced it. Those brief windows of freedom made the modern world. Their energy is spent. The next awakening requires the same thing: the reassertion of the freedom to think.","Censorship harms conventional thinkers most, by intimidating them from pursuing independent thought. Intellectual vitality in a society requires freedom to question fundamentals.

The answer: it degrades into dead dogma. A belief that is never tested, never forced to defend itself, never confronted with serious objections, ceases to be a living truth in the mind of whoever holds it. However true the proposition, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held the way most people hold most of their opinions -- as an inherited formula, not a reasoned conviction.","Let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dismissing the supposition that any of the received opinions may be false, let us assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the manner in which they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely and openly canvassed.

2.25,1209,0,0%,"Some people think it is enough for a person to accept a true doctrine without question, with no understanding of its foundations and no ability to defend it against even basic objections. If they can get their creed taught as authoritative, they see no benefit and considerable risk in allowing it to be questioned.

But this strategy backfires. When you prevent all discussion of a belief, you make it nearly impossible for anyone to reject it thoughtfully and intelligently -- but you cannot prevent them from rejecting it rashly and ignorantly. Beliefs not grounded in genuine conviction collapse at the first plausible-sounding objection.

Even if the true belief survives in the mind, it survives as prejudice -- a conviction disconnected from evidence and argument, immune to rational engagement. This is not knowing the truth. It is superstition that happens to coincide with truth -- words that state something correct without the speaker understanding why they are correct.","There is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as formerly) who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to what they think true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds of the opinion, and could not make a tenable defence of it against the most superficial objections. Such persons, if they can once get their creed taught from authority, naturally think that no good, and some harm, comes of its being allowed to be questioned. Where their influence prevails, they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be rejected wisely and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashly and ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible, and when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt to give way before the slightest semblance of an argument. Waving, however, this possibility—assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind, but abides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against, argument—this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by a rational being. This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.",,"A truth accepted on authority alone, without understanding its grounds, is not knowledge -- it is superstition that happens to be right.

2.26,5012,0,0%,"If we believe intellect and judgment should be cultivated -- and most people claim to believe this -- then on what better subject can those faculties be exercised than the questions considered most important in life? If cultivating the understanding means anything, it means learning the grounds of one's own beliefs. On any subject that matters, a person ought to be able to defend their position against at least the common objections.

The objection arises: cannot people be taught the grounds of their opinions without hearing those opinions attacked? Students learn geometry by studying proofs, not by hearing someone try to disprove the theorems. True -- but mathematics is a special case. In math, all the argument is on one side. There are no objections to answer. On every subject where genuine disagreement is possible -- morals, politics, religion, social questions -- the truth depends on weighing conflicting considerations. Three-quarters of the case for any disputed position consists in answering the strongest arguments for the opposing view.

Cicero, the greatest orator of antiquity save one, made it his practice to study his adversary's case with even greater intensity than his own. Anyone who wants to arrive at truth, not merely win an argument, must do the same. A person who knows only their own side of a question knows little of it. Their reasons may be sound, but if they cannot answer the strongest reasons on the other side -- if they do not even know what those reasons are -- they have no rational basis for their position.

And it is not enough to hear the opposing arguments summarized by friendly teachers who present them only to refute them. That is not genuine engagement. You must hear the arguments from people who actually believe them, who defend them with full conviction and maximum force. You must feel the real weight of the difficulty your position must overcome. Otherwise, you will never truly possess the portion of truth that addresses and resolves that difficulty.

Ninety-nine out of a hundred educated people are in this condition. They may argue fluently for their views, but they have never inhabited the mental world of those who disagree. They do not know the parts of their own doctrine that explain why seemingly conflicting evidence is reconcilable, or why one of two apparently strong arguments should prevail over the other. All that part of truth that tips the balance and decides the judgment of a fully informed mind -- they are strangers to it.

So essential is this discipline that if genuine opponents of important truths do not exist, it is indispensable to invent them -- and to supply them with the strongest arguments the most skilled devil's advocate can construct.","If the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thing which Protestants at least do not deny, on what can these faculties be more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things which concern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to hold opinions on them? If the cultivation of the understanding consists in one thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of one’s own opinions. Whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is of the first importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to defend against at least the common objections. But, some one may say, “Let them be
taught the grounds of their opinions. It does not follow that opinions must be merely parroted because they are never heard controverted. Persons who learn geometry do not simply commit the theorems to memory, but understand and learn likewise the demonstrations; and it would be absurd to say that they remain ignorant of the grounds of geometrical truths, because they never hear any one deny, and attempt to disprove them.” Undoubtedly: and such teaching suffices on a subject like mathematics, where there is nothing at all to be said on the wrong side of the question. The peculiarity of the evidence of mathematical truths is, that all the argument is on one side. There are no objections, and no answers to objections. But on every subject on which difference of opinion is possible, the truth depends on a balance to be struck between two sets of conflicting reasons. Even in natural philosophy, there is always some other explanation possible of the same facts; some geocentric theory instead of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxygen; and it has to be shown why that other theory cannot be the true one: and until this is shown, and until we know how it is shown, we do not understand the grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to subjects infinitely more complicated, to morals, religion, politics, social relations, and the business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed opinion consist in dispelling the appearances which favour some opinion different from it. The greatest orator, save one, of antiquity, has left it on record that he always studied his adversary’s case with as great, if not with still greater, intensity than even his own. What Cicero practised as the means of forensic success, requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order to arrive at the truth. He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is either led by authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, the side to which he feels most inclination. Nor is it enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into real contact with his own mind. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty which the true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else he will never really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets and removes that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called educated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently for their opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it might be false for anything they know: they have never thrown themselves into the mental position of those who think differently from them, and considered what such persons may have to say; and consequently they do not, in any proper sense of the word, know the doctrine which they themselves profess. They do not know those parts of it which explain and justify the remainder; the considerations which show that a fact which seemingly conflicts with another is reconcilable with it, or that, of two apparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be preferred. All that part of the truth which turns the scale, and decides the judgment of a completely informed mind, they are strangers to; nor is it ever really known, but to those who have attended equally and impartially to both sides, and endeavoured to see the reasons of both in the strongest light. So essential is this discipline to a real understanding of moral and human subjects, that if opponents of all important truths do not exist, it is indispensable to imagine them, and supply them with the strongest arguments which the most skilful devil’s advocate can conjure up.",,"Cicero studied his opponent's case more intensely than his own.

2.28,2531,0,0%,"Even granting this argument its fullest force, it still requires free discussion. Even if ordinary people may defer to experts, those experts need to hear the strongest objections stated freely and forcefully to produce genuine answers. How can an objection be answered if it cannot be stated? How can we know an answer is adequate if the objector has no opportunity to show it is not?

The Catholic Church recognized this problem and developed its own solution: a strict separation between those permitted to encounter opposing arguments (the clergy) and those who must accept doctrine on faith (the laity). Clergy could read heretical works to prepare refutations; laypeople could not without special permission. This gave the educated elite more intellectual culture -- though not more intellectual freedom -- than the general population. It produced clever advocates rather than open-minded thinkers.

But in Protestant cultures, this solution is unavailable. Protestantism holds, at least in theory, that every person bears individual responsibility for their own religious conclusions. And in the modern world, it is practically impossible to prevent ordinary readers from accessing anything available to the educated. If those who teach need access to all arguments, then all arguments must be free to be published without restriction.","Conceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed for it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding of truth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argument for free discussion is no way weakened. For even this doctrine acknowledges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that all objections have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how can the answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no opportunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? If not the public, at least the philosophers and theologians who are to resolve the difficulties, must make themselves familiar with those difficulties in their most puzzling form; and this cannot be accomplished unless they are freely stated, and placed in the most advantageous light which they admit of. The Catholic Church has its own way of dealing with this embarrassing problem. It makes a broad separation between those who can be permitted to receive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must accept them on trust. Neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to what they will accept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided in, may admissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the arguments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore, read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard to be obtained. This discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy’s case as beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with this, of denying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the
élite more mental culture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows to the mass. By this device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mental superiority which its purposes require; for though culture without freedom never made a large and liberal mind, it can make a clever
nisi prius advocate of a cause. But in countries professing Protestantism, this resource is denied; since Protestants hold, at least in theory, that the responsibility for the choice of a religion must be borne by each for himself, and cannot be thrown off upon teachers. Besides, in the present state of the world, it is practically impossible that writings which are read by the instructed can be kept from the uninstructed.

The fact, however, is, that not only the grounds of the opinion are forgotten in the absence of discussion, but too often the meaning of the opinion itself. The words which convey it, cease to suggest ideas, or suggest only a small portion of those they were originally employed to communicate. Instead of a vivid conception and a living belief, there remain only a few phrases retained by rote; or, if any part, the shell and husk only of the meaning is retained, the finer essence being lost.

2.30,3274,0,0%,"Every doctrine follows the same lifecycle. In its origin and early development, it is alive -- charged with meaning, vitality, and urgency. Its founders and first converts feel its significance intensely, and the struggle for acceptance sharpens that feeling further. But once a doctrine wins its battle -- becoming the general opinion, or at least an established option -- controversy fades and complacency sets in.

The belief becomes inherited rather than chosen. Converts are rare. Adherents no longer need to defend their position or persuade others, so they stop engaging with either the arguments for or against their creed. This is when the living power of the doctrine begins to die. Teachers lament the difficulty of keeping its meaning vivid and relevant. But no such difficulty existed when the creed was still fighting for survival -- even the least articulate believers knew what they stood for and why it mattered.

Once a belief becomes a passive inheritance rather than an active commitment -- once the mind no longer wrestles with the questions it poses -- there is a steady drift toward retaining nothing but the formulas. Assent becomes dull and automatic. The belief ceases to connect with the person's inner life, doing nothing for the mind or heart, yet standing like a sentinel that blocks any fresh conviction from entering.","It is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and religious creeds. They are all full of meaning and vitality to those who originate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators. Their meaning continues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhaps brought out into even fuller consciousness, so long as the struggle lasts to give the doctrine or creed an ascendancy over other creeds. At last it either prevails, and becomes the general opinion, or its progress stops; it keeps possession of the ground it has gained, but ceases to spread further. When either of these results has become apparent, controversy on the subject flags, and gradually dies away. The doctrine has taken its place, if not as a received opinion, as one of the admitted sects or divisions of opinion: those who hold it have generally inherited, not adopted it; and conversion from one of these doctrines to another, being now an exceptional fact, occupies little place in the thoughts of their professors. Instead of being, as at first, constantly on the alert either to defend themselves against the world, or to bring the world over to them, they have subsided into acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, to arguments against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such) with arguments in its favour. From this time may usually be dated the decline in the living power of the doctrine. We often hear the teachers of all creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believers a lively apprehension of the truth which they nominally recognise, so that it may penetrate the feelings, and acquire a real mastery over the conduct. No such difficulty is complained of while the creed is still fighting for its existence: even the weaker combatants then know and feel what they are fighting for, and the difference between it and other doctrines; and in that period of every creed’s existence, not a few persons may be found, who have realized its fundamental principles in all the forms of thought, have weighed and considered them in all their important bearings, and have experienced the full effect on the character, which belief in that creed ought to produce in a mind thoroughly imbued with it. But when it has come to be an hereditary creed, and to be received passively, not actively—when the mind is no longer compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exercise its vital powers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is a progressive tendency to forget all of the belief except the formularies, or to give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it on trust dispensed with the necessity of realizing it in consciousness, or testing it by personal experience; until it almost ceases to connect itself at all with the inner life of the human being. Then are seen the cases, so frequent in this age of the world as almost to form the majority, in which the creed remains as it were outside the mind, incrusting and petrifying it against all other influences addressed to the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its power by not suffering any fresh and living conviction to get in, but itself doing nothing for the mind or heart, except standing sentinel over them to keep them vacant.",,"Every belief is most alive when it is fighting for survival. Win the battle, and complacency sets in. The doctrine becomes inherited, not chosen. Its words are recited, but its meaning drains away. Eventually it stands like a guard at the door of the mind -- letting nothing new in, but doing nothing useful itself.","Doctrines are most vital during their founding struggle. Once established, they become inherited rather than chosen, and their living meaning decays into rote formula -- blocking fresh thought without providing genuine conviction.","A belief is most alive when fighting for survival; once victorious, it calcifies into a formula that guards the mind without nourishing it.",2,30,,,,,"[Lifecycle of doctrines] -- Mill describes a sociological pattern: the vitality of a movement is highest during its period of opposition and declines upon achieving dominance.

2.31,3039,0,0%,"Christianity illustrates this perfectly. The maxims of the New Testament are considered sacred law by all professing Christians. Yet it is hardly an exaggeration to say that not one Christian in a thousand actually tests their daily conduct against those maxims. The real standard people follow is the custom of their class, their nation, their professional circle.

Every Christian professes to believe that the blessed are the poor and humble; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven; that one should judge not, love one's neighbor as oneself, give one's cloak to whoever takes one's coat, take no thought for tomorrow, and sell everything to give to the poor. They are not being insincere when they say they believe these things. They believe them the way people believe anything they have heard praised all their lives but never examined. They believe them up to the point where it is customary to act on them -- and not an inch further.

The doctrines serve as ammunition against opponents and as decorative justifications for things people were going to do anyway. But anyone who pointed out that these maxims demand an infinity of things that believers never even consider doing would simply be dismissed as annoyingly self-righteous. The doctrines have no active grip on the minds of ordinary believers. People feel habitual respect for the sound of them but no connection between the words and the conduct they describe. Whenever actual behavior is at stake, they look to social convention for guidance.","To what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest impression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, without being ever realized in the imagination, the feelings, or the understanding, is exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers hold the doctrines of Christianity. By Christianity I here mean what is accounted such by all churches and sects—the maxims and precepts contained in the New Testament. These are considered sacred, and accepted as laws, by all professing Christians. Yet it is scarcely too much to say that not one Christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual conduct by reference to those laws. The standard to which he does refer it, is the custom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession. He has thus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believes to have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for his government; and on the other, a set of every-day judgments and practices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not so great a length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are, on the whole, a compromise between the Christian creed and the interests and suggestions of worldly life. To the first of these standards he gives his homage; to the other his real allegiance. All Christians believe that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; that they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not at all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves; that if one take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they should take no thought for the morrow; that if they would be perfect, they should sell all that they have and give it to the poor. They are not insincere when they say that they believe these things. They do believe them, as people believe what they have always heard lauded and never discussed. But in the sense of that living belief which regulates conduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which it is usual to act upon them. The doctrines in their integrity are serviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are to be put forward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people do that they think laudable. But any one who reminded them that the maxims require an infinity of things which they never even think of doing, would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopular characters who affect to be better than other people. The doctrines have no hold on ordinary believers—are not a power in their minds. They have an habitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads from the words to the things signified, and forces the mind to take
them in, and make them conform to the formula. Whenever conduct is concerned, they look round for Mr. A and B to direct them how far to go in obeying Christ.",,"Every Christian professes to believe the Sermon on the Mount. Almost none test their conduct against it. The maxims serve as rhetorical weapons and decorative justifications, not as guides to action. People believe them the way they believe anything they have heard praised all their lives but never examined: up to the point where custom permits, and not one step further.","Most Christians profess belief in the radical ethical demands of the New Testament but follow social custom instead.

2.32,1642,0,0%,"The early Christians were nothing like this. Had they been, Christianity would never have grown from a small sect into the religion of an empire. When outsiders remarked, 'See how these Christians love one another' -- an observation no one would make today -- early believers had a vivid, living grasp of their creed that has not been equaled since. And this is probably why Christianity has made so little progress in extending its reach: after two thousand years, it remains largely confined to populations of European descent.

Even among the most devout today, the parts of doctrine that remain vital are usually those added by later theologians like Calvin or Knox -- figures more familiar in temperament to modern believers than the original source. The actual sayings of Jesus coexist passively in people's minds, producing little beyond the mild effect of hearing words that sound pleasant. There are many reasons why the distinctive doctrines of a particular sect retain more vitality than beliefs shared by all denominations. But one reason is certain: sectarian doctrines are questioned more often and must be defended more vigorously. Both teachers and followers fall asleep at their posts the moment there is no challenger in the field.","Now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrews into the religion of the Roman empire. When their enemies said, “See how these Christians love one another” (a remark not likely to be made by anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause, probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still nearly confined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines, and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively active in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, or some such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland. There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognised sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers.

2.33,1451,0,0%,"The same pattern extends far beyond religion to all traditional wisdom. Languages and literatures overflow with observations about life -- proverbs, maxims, common sayings -- that everyone knows, everyone repeats, and almost no one truly understands until painful experience makes them real. How often does a person, stung by some unforeseen disaster, suddenly recall a familiar saying whose meaning, had they ever truly grasped it before, would have saved them from exactly that mistake?

Some of this is inevitable: certain truths can only be fully understood through direct experience. But far more of their meaning would be grasped in advance if people were accustomed to hearing them seriously argued and contested by those who genuinely understood them. The fundamental human tendency to stop thinking about anything the moment it is no longer in doubt is the cause of half our errors. As one writer put it: the deep slumber of a decided opinion.","The same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional doctrines—those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of morals or religion. All languages and literatures are full of general observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which most people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally of a painful kind, has made it a reality to them. How often, when smarting under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person call to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all his life, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, would have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this, other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the full meaning
cannot be realized, until personal experience has brought it home. But much more of the meaning even of these would have been understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply impressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it argued
pro and
con by people who did understand it. The fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has well spoken of “the deep slumber of a decided opinion.”",,"Proverbs and maxims fill every language -- known by all, understood by almost none, until pain makes them real.

The well-being of civilization can almost be measured by how many important truths have reached the point of being uncontested. The end of serious controversy on one question after another is a natural and healthy feature of intellectual progress.

But acknowledging this does not mean every consequence of consensus is beneficial. The loss of adversarial testing -- the sharpening that comes from having to explain and defend a truth against real challengers -- is a genuine cost, even when the benefits of consensus clearly outweigh it. Where natural opposition has disappeared, I would want to see educators actively creating substitutes: intellectual exercises that make the difficulties of a question as vivid and pressing as they would be if a determined opponent were trying to convert you.","I affirm no such thing. As mankind improve, the number of doctrines which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the increase: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by the number and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of being uncontested. The cessation, on one question after another, of serious controversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation of opinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as it is dangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous. But though this gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion is necessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and indispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its consequences must be beneficial. The loss of so important an aid to the intelligent and living apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the necessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents, though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the benefit of its universal recognition. Where this advantage can no longer be had, I confess I should like to see the teachers of mankind endeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for making the difficulties of the question as present to the learner’s consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient champion, eager for his conversion.",,"Consensus on truth is a mark of progress, not a defect.

2.36,3283,0,0%,"Instead of creating such substitutes, modern education has lost the ones that once existed. The Socratic dialogues of Plato were exactly this kind of tool -- a systematic method for demonstrating to anyone who held conventional opinions that they did not actually understand what they professed to believe. The point was not to destroy belief but to replace shallow acceptance with genuine understanding. Becoming aware of your own ignorance was the first step toward stable, well-founded conviction.

The medieval scholastic disputations served a similar purpose: forcing students to demonstrate that they understood both their own position and its opposite, and could defend one while refuting the other. These had the serious flaw of arguing from authority rather than reason, and were in every way inferior to genuine Socratic dialectic. But both methods deserve far more credit than modern education gives them, and nothing in current pedagogy fills the gap left by either.

Today, people who learn entirely from teachers and books -- even the best-intentioned ones -- are never compelled to hear both sides. It is rare even among intellectuals to genuinely know both sides of a question. The weakest part of anyone's position is almost always their response to opposing arguments. And the current fashion is to dismiss negative criticism -- the identification of weaknesses in a theory -- as a second-rate intellectual activity. But as a method for reaching genuine knowledge, it is indispensable. Until people are systematically trained in it again, there will be few great thinkers and a low general level of intellectual rigor.

So when genuine challengers to received opinions do exist, they should be welcomed. They are doing for us what we would otherwise have to do, at much greater effort, for ourselves. If anyone contests a prevailing view, or would do so if allowed, we should thank them, listen to them, and recognize that they serve both the certainty and the vitality of our own convictions.","But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lost those they formerly had. The Socratic dialectics, so magnificently exemplified in the dialogues of Plato, were a contrivance of this description. They were essentially a negative discussion of the great questions of philosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to the purpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of received opinion, that he did not understand the subject—that he as yet attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to attain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of the meaning of doctrines and of their evidence. The school disputations of the middle ages had a somewhat similar object. They were intended to make sure that the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary correlation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of the one and confute those of the other. These last-mentioned contests had indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were taken from authority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind, they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics which formed the intellects of the “Socratici viri:” but the modern mind owes far more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the present modes of education contain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies the place either of the one or of the other. A person who derives all his instruction from teachers or books, even if he escape the besetting temptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion to hear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment, even among thinkers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of what everybody says in defence of his opinion, is what he intends as a reply to antagonists. It is the fashion of the present time to disparage negative logic—that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in practice, without establishing positive truths. Such negative criticism would indeed be poor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to attaining any positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it cannot be valued too highly; and until people are again systematically trained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low general average of intellect, in any but the mathematical and physical departments of speculation. On any other subject no one’s opinions deserve the name of knowledge, except so far as he has either had forced upon him by others, or gone through of himself, the same mental process which would have been required of him in carrying on an active controversy with opponents. That, therefore, which when absent, it is so indispensable, but so difficult, to create, how worse than absurd is it to forego, when spontaneously offering itself! If there are any persons who contest a received opinion, or who will do so if law or opinion will let them, let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them, and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought, if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our convictions, to do with much greater labor for ourselves.",,"Plato's Socratic dialogues were designed to prove to the complacent that they did not understand their own beliefs.

2.37,2760,0,0%,"There is a third and even more common possibility beyond the two already considered. We have examined the case where the received opinion is false and the dissenting one true, and the case where the received opinion is true but needs challenge to stay alive. But most often, neither side has the whole truth. Both the mainstream view and the dissenting one each contain a piece of it.

Popular opinions on complex subjects are rarely completely wrong, but they are almost never the complete truth either. They capture part of the picture -- sometimes a large part, sometimes a small one -- but exaggerated, distorted, cut off from the complementary truths that should accompany them. Dissenting opinions, meanwhile, typically embody exactly those neglected truths that the mainstream view suppresses.

This is why one-sidedness, not falsehood, is the usual condition of human belief. Even in revolutions of thought, one partial truth tends to replace another rather than combining with it. Progress typically means substituting the partial truth that the current era needs most for the one it has outgrown -- not achieving a comprehensive view.

Given this reality, every opinion that captures some portion of truth the mainstream misses should be treated as precious, however much error it is mixed with. As long as popular truth is one-sided, it is better that unpopular truth also have passionate, one-sided advocates -- because those are the people most likely to force attention to the piece of the puzzle everyone else is ignoring.","It still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make diversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so until mankind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which at present seems at an incalculable distance. We have hitherto considered only two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and some other opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion being true, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear apprehension and deep feeling of its truth. But there is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the truth, of which the received doctrine embodies only a part. Popular opinions, on subjects not palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom or never the whole truth. They are a part of the truth; sometimes a greater, sometimes a smaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and disjoined from the truths by which they ought to be accompanied and limited. Heretical opinions, on the other hand, are generally some of these suppressed and neglected truths, bursting the bonds which kept them down, and either seeking reconciliation with the truth contained in the common opinion, or fronting it as enemies, and setting themselves up, with similar exclusiveness, as the whole truth. The latter case is hitherto the most frequent, as, in the human mind, one-sidedness has always been the rule, and many-sidedness the exception. Hence, even in revolutions of opinion, one part of the truth usually sets while another rises. Even progress, which ought to superadd, for the most part only substitutes, one partial and incomplete truth for another; improvement consisting chiefly in this, that the new fragment of truth is more wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time, than that which it displaces. Such being the partial character of prevailing opinions, even when resting on a true foundation, every opinion which embodies somewhat of the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to be considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that truth may be blended. No sober judge of human affairs will feel bound to be indignant because those who force on our notice truths which we should otherwise have overlooked, overlook some of those which we see. Rather, he will think that so long as popular truth is one-sided, it is more desirable than otherwise that unpopular truth should have one-sided asserters too; such being usually the most energetic, and the most likely to compel reluctant attention to the fragment of wisdom which they proclaim as if it were the whole.",,"Most disagreements are not between truth and falsehood but between complementary fragments of truth, each mistaking itself for the whole. Progress usually means replacing one partial truth with another that better fits the era. Every dissenting opinion that captures some neglected piece of reality is precious -- because one-sided truths need one-sided challengers to force the rest of us to look at what we are missing.","Most disputes involve partial truths on both sides, not a contest between truth and falsehood.

2.38,1548,0,0%,"Rousseau provides the perfect illustration. In the eighteenth century, educated Europe was intoxicated with the achievements of modern civilization -- science, literature, philosophy -- and convinced of its decisive superiority over all earlier ages. Into this complacent consensus, Rousseau's ideas landed like explosives, shattering the one-sided mass of opinion and forcing its fragments to recombine in a richer form.

Rousseau was not more right than the mainstream -- he was, on balance, further from the truth, containing more error and less positive insight. But his work carried exactly those truths the mainstream was ignoring: the value of simplicity, the corrupting effects of artificial social conventions, the moral cost of sophistication. These ideas have never entirely left cultivated minds since Rousseau wrote them, even if they still need asserting as urgently as ever.","Thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all those of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admiration of what is called civilization, and of the marvels of modern science, literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount of unlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times, indulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their own favour; with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of Rousseau explode like bombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided opinion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and with additional ingredients. Not that the current opinions were on the whole farther from the truth than Rousseau’s were; on the contrary, they were nearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much less of error. Nevertheless there lay in Rousseau’s doctrine, and has floated down the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount of exactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are the deposit which was left behind when the flood subsided. The superior worth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralizing effect of the trammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have never been entirely absent from cultivated minds since Rousseau wrote; and they will in time produce their due effect, though at present needing to be asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for words, on this subject, have nearly exhausted their power.",,"Rousseau was wrong about more than he was right.

Each mode of thinking is kept sane by the opposition of its counterpart. Democracy and hierarchy, equality and meritocracy, cooperation and competition, liberty and discipline, individual freedom and social cohesion -- unless both sides of every fundamental tension are expressed with equal freedom and defended with equal ability, one scale will inevitably tip. Truth in practical life is so much a matter of balancing and combining opposites that very few minds are capacious enough to manage it alone. For most questions, the balance must be struck through open struggle between committed partisans.

Of any two opposing positions on a major question, the one that most deserves encouragement is whichever is currently in the minority -- because that is the one representing the neglected interest, the side of human well-being in danger of getting less than its share. Whenever someone dissents from what appears to be universal agreement, it is almost always probable they have something worth hearing. Truth would lose something by their silence.","In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of a healthy state of political life; until the one or the other shall have so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally of order and of progress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be preserved from what ought to be swept away. Each of these modes of thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it is in a great measure the opposition of the other that keeps each within the limits of reason and sanity. Unless opinions favourable to democracy and to aristocracy, to property and to equality, to co-operation and to competition, to luxury and to abstinence, to sociality and individuality, to liberty and discipline, and all the other standing antagonisms of practical life, are expressed with equal freedom, and enforced and defended with equal talent and energy, there is no chance of both elements obtaining their due; one scale is sure to go up, and the other down. Truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much a question of the reconciling and combining of opposites, that very few have minds sufficiently capacious and impartial to make the adjustment with an approach to correctness, and it has to be made by the rough process of a struggle between combatants fighting under hostile banners. On any of the great open questions just enumerated, if either of the two opinions has a better claim than the other, not merely to be tolerated, but to be encouraged and countenanced, it is the one which happens at the particular time and place to be in a minority.

2.40,4856,0,0%,"Someone will object: Christian morality is not a partial truth -- it is the complete truth about how to live, and anyone who teaches differently is simply wrong. This objection deserves the most thorough examination, because if it fails in this strongest case, it fails everywhere.

First, what do we mean by ""Christian morality""? If we mean the New Testament alone, anyone who reads it carefully will see that it was never meant as a complete ethical system. The Gospels assume a pre-existing morality and add to it selectively, often in language more poetic than precise. A workable ethical code has never been extracted from the New Testament alone without supplementing it from the Old Testament -- a system designed for a very different era and people. Paul himself assumed the existing Greek and Roman moral framework and adapted his advice to accommodate it -- even to the point of tacitly accepting slavery.

What we call ""Christian morality"" is largely a construction of the first five centuries of the Church, modified but not fundamentally transformed by the Reformation. It has the character of a reaction against paganism -- emphasizing the negative over the positive, innocence over greatness, abstinence from evil over energetic pursuit of good. ""Thou shalt not"" predominates over ""thou shalt."" In its fear of sensuality, it elevated asceticism to an ideal. It motivates virtue through hope of heaven and fear of hell -- a framework that the best pagan philosophers would have considered degradingly selfish, disconnecting duty from genuine concern for others. It preaches submission to established authority and says remarkably little about civic duty or obligation to the public good.

Whatever exists in our moral tradition of magnanimity, personal dignity, civic responsibility, and active courage comes not from Christianity but from Greek, Roman, and secular sources. Christian morality has contributed enormously, but to insist it is the whole of ethics is to deny the contribution of everything else -- and to produce a servile, diminished character incapable of aspiring to genuine greatness.","It may be objected, “But
some received principles, especially on the highest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths. The Christian morality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject, and if any one teaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in error.” As this is of all cases the most important in practice, none can be fitter to test the general maxim. But before pronouncing what Christian morality is or is not, it would be desirable to decide what is meant by Christian morality. If it means the morality of the New Testament, I wonder that any one who derives his knowledge of this from the book itself, can suppose that it was announced, or intended, as a complete doctrine of morals. The Gospel always refers to a pre-existing morality, and confines its precepts to the particulars in which that morality was to be corrected, or superseded by a wider and higher; expressing itself, moreover, in terms most general, often impossible to be interpreted literally, and possessing rather the impressiveness of poetry or eloquence than the precision of legislation. To extract from it a body of ethical doctrine, has never been possible without eking it out from the Old Testament, that is, from a system elaborate indeed, but in many respects barbarous, and intended only for a barbarous people. St. Paul, a declared enemy to this Judaical mode of interpreting the doctrine and filling up the scheme of his Master, equally assumes a pre-existing morality, namely, that of the Greeks and Romans; and his advice to Christians is in a great measure a system of accommodation to that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanction to slavery. What is called Christian, but should rather be termed theological, morality, was not the work of Christ or the Apostles, but is of much later origin, having been gradually built up by the Catholic church of the first five centuries, and though not implicitly adopted by moderns and Protestants, has been much less modified by them than might have been expected. For the most part, indeed, they have contented themselves with cutting off the additions which had been made to it in the middle ages, each sect supplying the place by fresh additions, adapted to its own character and tendencies. That mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to its early teachers, I should be the last person to deny; but I do not scruple to say of it, that it is, in many important points, incomplete and one-sided, and that unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it, had contributed to the formation of European life and character, human affairs would have been in a worse condition than they now are. Christian morality (so called) has all the characters of a reaction; it is, in great part, a protest against Paganism. Its ideal is negative rather than positive; passive rather than active; Innocence rather than Nobleness; Abstinence from Evil, rather than energetic Pursuit of Good: in its precepts (as has been well said) “thou shalt not” predominates unduly over “thou shalt.” In its horror of sensuality, it made an idol of asceticism, which has been gradually compromised away into one of legality. It holds out the hope of heaven and the threat of hell, as the appointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life: in this falling far below the best of the ancients, and doing what lies in it to give to human morality an essentially selfish character, by disconnecting each man’s feelings of duty from the interests of his fellow-creatures, except so far as a self-interested inducement is offered to him for consulting them. It is essentially a doctrine of passive obedience; it inculcates submission to all authorities found established; who indeed are not to be actively obeyed when they command what religion forbids, but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelled against, for any amount of wrong to ourselves. And while, in the morality of the best Pagan nations, duty to the State holds even a disproportionate place, infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purely Christian ethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed or acknowledged. It is in the
Koran, not the New Testament, that we read the maxim—”A ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there is in his dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against God and against the State.” What little recognition the idea of obligation to the public obtains in modern morality, is derived from Greek and Roman sources, not from Christian; as, even in the morality of private life, whatever exists of magnanimity, highmindedness, personal dignity, even the sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religious part of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard of ethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of obedience.",,"Christian morality, properly examined, was never a complete ethical system. The New Testament assumes a pre-existing moral framework and supplements it selectively. What we call Christian ethics is largely a construction of the first five centuries -- reactive, negative in emphasis, focused on abstinence rather than greatness. Whatever magnanimity, civic duty, and active courage exist in our moral tradition come from Greek, Roman, and secular sources. To insist on Christian ethics as the whole of morality is to amputate everything that makes the moral life ambitious rather than merely obedient.","Christian morality was never a complete ethical system. It was built reactively against paganism, emphasizing prohibition over aspiration and obedience over greatness. Essential moral values like civic duty, personal dignity, and magnanimity come from classical and secular sources, not from Christianity alone.","Christian morality contributes enormously to ethics, but to claim it as the whole is to amputate magnanimity, civic courage, and every moral aspiration beyond obedience.",2,40,,,,,"[New Testament ethics] -- Mill argues the Gospels were supplementary, not comprehensive, in their moral instruction.

2.41,3616,0,0%,"I am not arguing that these limitations are inherent in Christianity itself, or that Christ's own teachings are incompatible with a complete morality. I believe the sayings of Jesus are reconcilable with everything a comprehensive ethics requires. But they were clearly intended to provide only part of the picture. Many essential elements of the highest morality were left unprovided for -- deliberately -- and have been entirely neglected in the ethical system the Church built on that foundation.

Insisting on Christian doctrine as the sole guide to moral life is therefore a serious practical error. It narrows moral education, producing people capable of obedience but incapable of aspiring to genuine greatness. When exclusively religious standards displace the secular traditions that historically complemented Christian ethics -- the classical ideals of civic virtue, personal excellence, and intellectual courage -- the result is a diminished character: submissive to what it takes to be the supreme will, but unable to rise to a conception of supreme goodness.

Christian ethics needs other moral traditions alongside it, not because Christianity is false, but because no single tradition captures the full truth about how to live. This is simply another instance of the general principle: in an imperfect world, the interests of truth require a diversity of perspectives.

If Christians want fairness toward Christianity, they must be fair to what lies outside it. It does truth no service to ignore the fact that a large portion of humanity's most valuable moral thinking has been the work of people who did not know, or who knew and rejected, the Christian faith.","I am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are necessarily inherent in the Christian ethics, in every manner in which it can be conceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral doctrine which it does not contain, do not admit of being reconciled with it. Far less would I insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts of Christ himself. I believe that the sayings of Christ are all, that I can see any evidence of their having been intended to be; that they are irreconcilable with nothing which a comprehensive morality requires; that everything which is excellent in ethics may be brought within them, with no greater violence to their language than has been done to it by all who have attempted to deduce from them any practical system of conduct whatever. But it is quite consistent with this, to believe that they contain, and were meant to contain, only a part of the truth; that many essential elements of the highest morality are among the things which are not provided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the recorded deliverances of the Founder of Christianity, and which have been entirely thrown aside in the system of ethics erected on the basis of those deliverances by the Christian Church. And this being so, I think it a great error to persist in attempting to find in the Christian doctrine that complete rule for our guidance, which its author intended it to sanction and enforce, but only partially to provide. I believe, too, that this narrow theory is becoming a grave practical evil, detracting greatly from the value of the moral training and instruction, which so many well-meaning persons are now at length exerting themselves to promote. I much fear that by attempting to form the mind and feelings on an exclusively religious type, and discarding those secular standards (as for want of a better name they may be called) which heretofore co-existed with and supplemented the Christian ethics, receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some of theirs, there will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, servile type of character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems the Supreme Will, is incapable of rising to or sympathizing in the conception of Supreme Goodness. I believe that other ethics than any one which can be evolved from exclusively Christian sources, must exist side by side with Christian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of mankind; and that the Christian system is no exception to the rule, that in an imperfect state of the human mind, the interests of truth require a diversity of opinions. It is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truths not contained in Christianity, men should ignore any of those which it does contain. Such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is altogether an evil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, and must be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good. The exclusive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole, must and ought to be protested against; and if a reactionary impulse should make the protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness, like the other, may be lamented, but must be tolerated. If Christians would teach infidels to be just to Christianity, they should themselves be just to infidelity. It can do truth no service to blink the fact, known to all who have the most ordinary acquaintance with literary history, that a large portion of the noblest and most valuable moral teaching has been the work, not only of men who did not know, but of men who knew and rejected, the Christian faith.",,"The sayings of Jesus are reconcilable with everything a comprehensive ethics requires -- but they were never meant to be the whole of it. Insisting otherwise produces a diminished moral character: obedient but not great, submissive but not courageous. If Christians want the world to be fair to Christianity, they must be fair to the moral wisdom that comes from outside it -- including from those who rejected the faith entirely.","Christ's teachings are compatible with a complete morality but were never intended to provide one alone.

2.42,1603,0,0%,"I do not claim that unlimited freedom of discussion would eliminate sectarianism. People of narrow capacity who seize upon one truth will always treat it as though no other truth exists. Free discussion often makes partisans more extreme, not less -- the truth they had been ignoring gets rejected even more violently precisely because it is championed by people they regard as enemies.

But the value of free discussion lies not in its effect on the passionate partisan. It lies in its effect on the calmer, more disinterested observer. The formidable evil is not the violent clash between partial truths -- it is the quiet suppression of half the truth. There is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides. When they attend to only one, errors harden into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to function as truth by being stretched into falsehood.

Since few people possess the rare capacity to judge fairly between two sides of a question when only one side has an advocate, truth has no chance except in proportion to how well every fraction of it finds its voice and gets a genuine hearing.","I do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of enunciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of religious or philosophical sectarianism.

I acknowledge that the tendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not cured by the freest discussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated thereby; the truth which ought to have been, but was not, seen, being rejected all the more violently because proclaimed by persons regarded as opponents. But it is not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer and more disinterested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its salutary effect. Not the violent conflict between parts of the truth, but the quiet suppression of half of it, is the formidable evil; there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides; it is when they attend only to one that errors harden into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have the effect of truth, by being exaggerated into falsehood. And since there are few mental attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sit in intelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which only one is represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but in proportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies any fraction of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as to be listened to.",,"Free discussion will not cure the partisan.

2.47,4787,0,0%,"One final question before leaving this subject: what about the manner of discussion? Many people say they support free expression in principle, provided it remains temperate and within the bounds of fair debate. The problem is that these bounds are impossible to fix. In practice, an argument is deemed ""intemperate"" whenever it is effective. Every opponent who pushes hard and proves difficult to answer is perceived as having crossed the line, simply because strong feeling accompanied a strong argument.

But there is a deeper objection. The worst offenses in debate -- arguing dishonestly, suppressing evidence, misrepresenting the opposing view -- are committed constantly by people acting in perfect good faith who are not considered ignorant or malicious. These offenses are so pervasive and so difficult to prove intentional that neither law nor social sanction can effectively police them.

As for the cruder weapons -- invective, sarcasm, personal attacks -- the call to ban them would be more credible if it applied equally to both sides. In reality, these weapons are freely used against minority and dissenting views with social approval, while dissenters cannot employ them without being condemned. The worst abuse in debate is to stigmatize holders of the opposing view as bad or immoral people. Those who hold unpopular opinions are especially vulnerable to this, being few in number and lacking defenders. Yet they cannot retaliate in kind without it backfiring.

In practice, dissenting views can get a hearing only through careful moderation of language and scrupulous avoidance of unnecessary offense -- the slightest deviation costs them ground. Meanwhile, unmeasured hostility from the side of prevailing opinion actively deters people from holding or even listening to alternative views.

For the sake of truth and justice, then, it is far more important to restrain vituperation from the dominant side than from the dissenting one. But ultimately, neither law nor authority should regulate the manner of discussion. Public opinion should judge each case individually -- condemning dishonesty, malice, bigotry, and intolerance of feeling on whichever side they appear, without inferring bad character from the mere fact of holding a particular view. And we should honor anyone who, whatever their opinion, has the fairness to see and the honesty to state what their opponents and their arguments really are.","Before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take some notice of those who say, that the free expression of all opinions should be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and do not pass the bounds of fair discussion. Much might be said on the impossibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed; for if the test be offence to those whose opinion is attacked, I think experience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is telling and powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and whom they find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows any strong feeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent. But this, though an important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in a more fundamental objection. Undoubtedly the manner of asserting an opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objectionable, and may justly incur severe censure. But the principal offences of the kind are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal, to bring home to conviction. The gravest of them is, to argue sophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements of the case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion. But all this, even to the most aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good faith, by persons who are not considered, and in many other respects may not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the misrepresentation as morally culpable; and still less could law presume to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct. With regard to what is commonly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective, sarcasm, personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons would deserve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them equally to both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employment of them against the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing they may not only be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to obtain for him who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteous indignation. Yet whatever mischief arises from their use, is greatest when they are employed against the comparatively defenceless; and whatever unfair advantage can be derived by any opinion from this mode of asserting it, accrues almost exclusively to received opinions. The worst offence of this kind which can be committed by a polemic, is to stigmatize those who hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men. To calumny of this sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are peculiarly exposed, because they are in general few and uninfluential, and nobody but themselves feels much interested in seeing justice done them; but this weapon is, from the nature of the case, denied to those who attack a prevailing opinion: they can neither use it with safety to themselves, nor, if they could, would it do anything but recoil on their own cause. In general, opinions contrary to those commonly received can only obtain a hearing by studied moderation of language, and the most cautious avoidance of unnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever deviate even in a slight degree without losing ground: while unmeasured vituperation employed on the side of the prevailing opinion, really does deter people from professing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who profess them. For the interest, therefore, of truth and justice, it is far more important to restrain this employment of vituperative language than the other; and, for example, if it were necessary to choose, there would be much more need to discourage offensive attacks on infidelity, than on religion. It is, however, obvious that law and authority have no business with restraining either, while opinion ought, in every instance, to determine its verdict by the circumstances of the individual case; condemning every one, on whichever side of the argument he places himself, in whose mode of advocacy either want of candour, or malignity, bigotry or intolerance of feeling manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side which a person takes, though it be the contrary side of the question to our own: and giving merited honour to every one, whatever opinion he may hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state what his opponents and their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to their discredit, keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell, in their favour. This is the real morality of public discussion: and if often violated, I am happy to think that there are many controversialists who to a great extent observe it, and a still greater number who conscientiously strive towards it.",,"The demand for ""civil discourse"" sounds fair until you notice it is enforced selectively. Dissenters must be perfectly moderate to be heard at all; the dominant view can deploy invective and character attacks with impunity. The worst offense in debate is not rudeness but dishonesty -- misrepresenting opponents, suppressing evidence, arguing in bad faith. For the sake of truth, restraining the powerful side matters far more than policing the weak one. The true morality of public discussion: judge arguments by their honesty, not by which side makes them.","Calls for ""temperate"" discussion are selectively enforced against dissenters while the dominant side freely employs invective. The real standards for discussion should be honesty, fairness, and accurate representation of opposing views -- applied equally regardless of which side someone takes.","The demand for civility in debate is almost always a weapon of the powerful against the powerless -- true fairness means judging arguments by their honesty, not by which side makes them.",2,47,,,,,"[Civility as selective enforcement] -- Mill observes that calls for moderate discourse systematically disadvantage minority viewpoints while giving cover to the rhetoric of the majority -- a dynamic extensively documented in modern discourse analysis.
[Ad hominem as suppression tool] -- Mill identifies the stigmatization of dissenters as morally bad people as the most effective weapon against unpopular opinions.
[Asymmetric discourse norms] -- Mill's observation that dominant groups are permitted rhetorical aggression while dissenting groups are held to standards of perfect civility anticipates modern analyses of ""tone policing.""
[Morality of public discussion] -- Mill's proposed standard: judge the character of an argument (honesty, completeness, fairness in representing opponents) rather than the position it defends.

3.1,,,,"The previous chapter established that people must be free to form and express opinions. Now the harder question: should they also be free to act on those opinions, to live according to them, so long as they do so at their own risk?

The answer is yes, but with a critical qualification. Actions are not as free as opinions. Even opinions lose their protection when they become direct incitements to harm -- the same statement published in a newspaper is protected speech, but shouted to an angry crowd outside someone's home, it becomes something else entirely. Acts that cause unjustifiable harm to others can and must be restrained.

But when someone's choices affect only themselves, the same logic that protects free thought protects free action. We are fallible. Our collective wisdom is partial at best. Agreement born from suppressing dissent is worthless. And diversity of thought is not a defect to be corrected but a resource to be preserved -- at least until we become far better at grasping the full complexity of truth.

If different opinions are valuable while humanity remains imperfect, then so are different experiments in living. People should have the freedom to test different ways of life, provided they do not injure others, and let the results speak for themselves. In short: where your choices do not primarily affect others, individuality should prevail. When traditions and social customs dictate your life rather than your own character, something essential to both personal happiness and social progress is missing.","SUCH being the reasons which make it imperative that human beings should be free to form opinions, and to express their opinions without reserve; and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and through that to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, or asserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the same reasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their opinions—to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either physical or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own risk and peril. This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard. Acts of whatever kind, which, without justifiable cause, do harm to others, may be, and in the more important cases absolutely require to be, controlled by the unfavourable sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of mankind. The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people. But if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. That mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognizing all sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men’s modes of action, not less than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so is it that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person’s own character, but the traditions of customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress.",,"Free thought without free action is an incomplete liberty. The same fallibility that demands we tolerate dissenting opinions demands we tolerate dissenting lives. Our truths are half-truths; our customs are experiments that succeeded once, somewhere, for someone. If diversity of thought is valuable in an imperfect world, then so is diversity of living. Let people try different paths and let results, not conformity, be the judge. Where custom rules in place of character, both happiness and progress wither at the root.","The arguments for free expression apply equally to free action, provided no harm is done to others. Since human knowledge is always incomplete, diverse ways of living are as valuable as diverse opinions. When tradition replaces individual character as the guide to life, both personal happiness and social progress suffer.","If we need diverse opinions because we are fallible, we need diverse ways of living for exactly the same reason.",3,1,,,,,"Corn-dealers -- Mill references the contemporary debate over grain merchants accused of profiteering during food shortages, a recurring flashpoint in 19th-century British politics. The example of shouting inflammatory opinions to a mob was a recognized legal distinction in English common law between protected expression and incitement."
3.2,,,,"The hardest part of defending individuality is not showing how to protect it, but convincing people it matters in the first place. If people genuinely believed that the free development of individuality is essential to well-being -- not merely compatible with civilization, education, and culture, but a necessary condition of them all -- liberty would never be undervalued.

But most people do not think this way. The majority, comfortable with the world as it is (since they are the ones who shaped it), cannot see why their way of life should not be good enough for everyone. Worse, even reformers tend to view individual spontaneity not as a resource but as an obstacle -- something that gets in the way of implementing whatever they have decided is best for society.

Outside Germany, few people have grasped the principle that Wilhelm von Humboldt made the foundation of an entire treatise: that the ultimate purpose of human life is the fullest, most harmonious development of one's capacities into a complete whole. For this development, two things are required: freedom and a variety of circumstances. Together, these produce individual vitality and genuine originality.","In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encountered does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledged end, but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself. If it were felt that the free development of individuality is one of the leading essentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate element with all that is designated by the terms civilization, instruction, education, culture, but is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things; there would be no danger that liberty should be undervalued, and the adjustment of the boundaries between it and social control would present no extraordinary difficulty. But the evil is, that individual spontaneity is hardly recognised by the common modes of thinking, as having any intrinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account. The majority, being satisfied with the ways of mankind as they now are (for it is they who make them what they are), cannot comprehend why those ways should not be good enough for everybody; and what is more, spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reformers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and perhaps rebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these reformers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind. Few persons, out of Germany, even comprehend the meaning of the doctrine which Wilhelm Von Humboldt, so eminent both as asavant and as a politician, made the text of a treatise—that “the end of man, or that which is prescribed by the eternal or immutable dictates of reason, and not suggested by vague and transient desires, is the highest and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent whole;” that, therefore, the object “towards which every human being must ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on which especially those who design to influence their fellow-men must ever keep their eyes, is the individuality of power and development;” that for this there are two requisites, “freedom, and a variety of situations;” and that from the union of these arise “individual vigour and manifold diversity,” which combine themselves in “originality.”",,The real obstacle to individuality is not knowing how to protect it -- it is the widespread indifference to whether it matters at all. The majority made the world as it is and cannot fathom why it should not suit everyone. Even reformers treat spontaneity as an inconvenience. Yet Humboldt identified the deepest truth: the purpose of human life is the fullest development of one's powers into a coherent whole. That development requires two things -- freedom and variety of circumstances -- and from their union comes originality.,"The main barrier to protecting individuality is that most people do not value it. The majority assumes their way of life should suit everyone, and even reformers see spontaneity as an obstacle. Humboldt argued that the purpose of life is the full development of human capacities, requiring both freedom and diverse circumstances.",The greatest threat to individuality is not oppression but indifference -- most people simply cannot see why it matters.,3,2,,,,,"Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835) -- Prussian philosopher, linguist, and statesman who founded the University of Berlin. His treatise The Sphere and Duties of Government (Ideen zu einem Versuch, die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staates zu bestimmen) was written in 1792 but not published in full until 1852, with an English translation appearing in 1854, just five years before On Liberty. Mill quotes directly from this translation. Humboldt argued that the state should limit itself to ensuring security, leaving individuals free to develop themselves."

Mill's wife Harriet Taylor also admired Humboldt's work, and Mill chose a quotation from this treatise as the epigraph to On Liberty."
3.3,,,,"Even people unfamiliar with Humboldt's doctrine would concede the basic point once they think about it. No one truly believes that the ideal life consists entirely of copying others. Everyone agrees that people should bring some measure of their own judgment and character to bear on how they live. At the same time, no one sensible thinks people should ignore everything humanity has learned before them.

The real question is what to do with inherited wisdom once you have it. A mature person's task is not simply to absorb the lessons of experience but to interpret and apply them -- to determine which parts of the collective record actually fit their own circumstances and character.

Tradition and custom deserve respect as evidence of what has worked for others, but with three qualifications. First, the experience behind them may be too narrow or badly interpreted. Second, even correctly drawn lessons may not apply to you -- customs are designed for customary people in customary situations, and you may be neither. Third, and most importantly, even when a custom is good and fitting, following it merely because it is custom exercises none of the distinctively human faculties.

Perception, judgment, moral reasoning, the ability to discriminate -- these capacities develop only through active choice. A person who does something solely because others do it makes no choice at all. Like a muscle that atrophies from disuse, the mind weakens when it is never asked to decide for itself. Adopting a belief without understanding its grounds does not strengthen your reason; it erodes it. Acting from motives that are not your own does not build character; it deadens it.","Little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of Von Humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high a value attached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think, can only be one of degree. No one’s idea of excellence in conduct is that people should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. No one would assert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and into the conduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own judgment, or of their own individual character. On the other hand, it would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had as yet done nothing towards showing that one mode of existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that people should be so taught and trained in youth, as to know and benefit by the ascertained results of human experience. But it is the privilege and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way. It is for him to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstances and character. The traditions and customs of other people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught
them; presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference: but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have interpreted it rightly. Secondly, their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him. Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters; and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary. Thirdly, though the customs be both good as customs, and suitable to him, yet to conform to custom, merely
as custom, does not educate or develope in him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowment of a human being. The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised only in making a choice. He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice. He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what is best. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used. The faculties are called into no exercise by doing a thing merely because others do it, no more than by believing a thing only because others believe it. If the grounds of an opinion are not conclusive to the person’s own reason, his reason cannot be strengthened, but is likely to be weakened, by his adopting it: and if the inducements to an act are not such as are consentaneous to his own feelings and character (where affection, or the rights of others, are not concerned) it is so much done towards rendering his feelings and character inert and torpid, instead of active and energetic.",,"No one seriously believes the ideal life is pure imitation. The question is what you do with inherited wisdom: absorb it passively, or interpret it for yourself. Tradition deserves respect -- as evidence, not as authority. The experience behind it may be narrow, misread, or simply inapplicable to your situation. And even when custom fits perfectly, following it merely because it is custom exercises nothing distinctively human. Judgment, perception, moral reasoning -- these develop only through active choice. Do something only because others do it, and you make no choice at all. The mind, like a muscle, atrophies without use.","Everyone agrees people should bring some individual judgment to life, not merely copy others. Tradition is useful evidence but may be narrow, misinterpreted, or inapplicable. Most importantly, following custom purely as custom fails to develop the human faculties -- judgment, perception, and moral reasoning -- which grow only through active choice.","Custom deserves respect as evidence of what has worked, but following it without thought exercises nothing that makes us human.",3,3,,,,,"Mill's three objections to unreflective custom-following form a logical progression from empirical critique (the evidence may be bad) to philosophical critique (even good customs, followed blindly, stunt human development). This argument draws on the broader empiricist tradition of John Locke and David Hume, while anticipating later existentialist themes about authenticity."
3.4,,,,"Someone who lets the world choose their plan of life needs only one faculty: imitation. Someone who chooses for themselves needs all of them -- observation, reasoning, judgment, the ability to weigh alternatives and hold to a decision once made.

These capacities grow in proportion to how much of your life you actually direct. You could be steered down a safe path without ever exercising them. But at what cost?

What matters is not only what people accomplish but what kind of people they become. Among all the things worth perfecting, the most important is the human being itself. Even if every productive task could be performed by machines in human form, replacing actual people with them would be a profound loss. Human nature is not a mechanism to be assembled according to a blueprint and set running. It is a tree -- something that must grow outward in every direction, shaped by its own internal forces, becoming what it is through the process of living.","He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision. And these qualities he requires and exercises exactly in proportion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to his own judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might be guided in some good path, and kept out of harm’s way, without any of these things. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life is rightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importance surely is man himself. Supposing it were possible to get houses built, corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and even churches erected and prayers said, by machinery—by automatons in human form—it would be a considerable loss to exchange for these automatons even the men and women who at present inhabit the more civilized parts of the world, and who assuredly are but starved specimens of what nature can and will produce. Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develope itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing.",,"Let the world choose your life and you need only one skill: imitation. Choose it yourself and you need them all -- observation, judgment, resolve, the courage to hold a decision once made. You could be guided safely through life without ever developing these capacities. But what would you be? What matters is not just what people do but what they become in the doing. Human nature is not a machine built to specification. It is a tree, growing outward from its own internal forces, becoming itself only through the act of living.","Choosing your own path develops observation, judgment, and resolve; letting others choose for you requires only imitation. What matters is not just what people accomplish but what kind of people they become. Human nature is not a machine to be programmed but a living thing that must grow from within.",Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model -- it is a tree that must grow from its own internal forces.,3,4,,,,,"Mill's metaphor of the tree versus the machine became one of the most quoted passages in On Liberty and reflects the Romantic tradition's emphasis on organic development, influenced by Coleridge, Goethe, and Humboldt. The automaton image anticipates later concerns about mechanization and dehumanization in industrial society."
3.5,,,,"Most people will grant that we should exercise our understanding -- that thoughtfully following custom, or even occasionally departing from it, beats blind obedience. But they are far less willing to extend this to desires and impulses. Having strong desires of your own is widely treated as dangerous rather than valuable.

This is backwards. Desires and impulses are as much a part of a complete human being as beliefs and restraints. Strong impulses are dangerous only when they are unbalanced -- when one set of drives develops while others that should accompany them remain weak. People do not act badly because their desires are strong; they act badly because their conscience is weak. There is no natural link between strong impulses and poor self-governance. The connection runs the other way.

To say someone has stronger and more varied desires than average is simply to say they have more raw material to work with -- more capacity for both harm and good, but certainly more capacity for good. Strong impulses are just another word for energy, and an energetic nature will always yield more than a passive one. The same intensity that fuels powerful personal drives also fuels the deepest love of virtue and the most rigorous self-discipline.

Society should cultivate this energy, not reject the raw material from which exceptional people are made simply because it does not know how to shape them. A person whose desires and impulses genuinely express their own developed nature has character. One whose desires are not their own has no more character than an engine. If you believe individuality of desire should be suppressed, you are arguing that society has no use for strong natures -- and that a high average of human energy is undesirable.","It will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exercise their understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, or even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a blind and simply mechanical adhesion to it. To a certain extent it is admitted, that our understanding should be our own: but there is not the same willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be our own likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any strength, is anything but a peril and a snare. Yet desires and impulses are as much a part of a perfect human being, as beliefs and restraints: and strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when one set of aims and inclinations is developed into strength, while others, which ought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive. It is not because men’s desires are strong that they act ill; it is because their consciences are weak. There is no natural connexion between strong impulses and a weak conscience. The natural connexion is the other way. To say that one person’s desires and feelings are stronger and more various than those of another, is merely to say that he has more of the raw material of human nature, and is therefore capable, perhaps of more evil, but certainly of more good. Strong impulses are but another name for energy. Energy may be turned to bad uses; but more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and impassive one. Those who have most natural feeling, are always those whose cultivated feelings may be made the strongest. The same strong susceptibilities which make the personal impulses vivid and powerful, are also the source from whence are generated the most passionate love of virtue, and the sternest self-control. It is through the cultivation of these, that society both does its duty and protects its interests: not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows not how to make them. A person whose desires and impulses are his own—are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed and modified by his own culture—is said to have a character. One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam-engine has a character. If, in addition to being his own, his impulses are strong, and are under the government of a strong will, he has an energetic character. Whoever thinks that individuality of desires and impulses should not be encouraged to unfold itself, must maintain that society has no need of strong natures—is not the better for containing many persons who have much character—and that a high general average of energy is not desirable.",,"We accept that people should think for themselves, yet balk at the idea that they should want for themselves. This is incoherent. Strong desires are not the problem -- weak conscience is. There is no natural link between passionate impulse and poor judgment; the connection runs the other way. The same intensity that produces powerful drives produces the deepest virtue and the sternest self-control. To reject this energy is to reject the raw material from which every exceptional person is made. A person whose desires express their own nature has character. One whose desires are borrowed has no character at all -- no more than a machine does.",Strong desires and impulses are not inherently dangerous -- they become harmful only when conscience is weak. The same energy that fuels powerful drives also fuels deep virtue and self-discipline. Society should cultivate this energy rather than suppress it. A person whose desires genuinely express their own nature has character; one whose desires are borrowed has none.,People do not act badly because their desires are strong; they act badly because their conscience is weak.,3,5,,,,,"Mill's distinction between strong impulses and weak conscience challenges the prevailing Victorian moral psychology, which tended to equate passion with vice. His argument that 'strong impulses are but another name for energy' reflects Romantic influences, particularly William Blake's idea that 'Energy is Eternal Delight' (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, 1790). The steam-engine metaphor reflects the industrial context of Mill's era."
3.6,,,,"In earlier periods of history, individual energy genuinely was a threat. When powerful people routinely defied every rule and constraint, society had to fight to impose any order at all. Law and institutional authority -- like the medieval Popes struggling against the Emperors -- claimed control over the whole person, regulating all of life in order to govern character, because no subtler method existed.

But that era is over. Society has decisively won its contest with individuality, and the danger now runs in the opposite direction. The threat to human nature today is not an excess of personal impulse but a deficiency of it.

From the top of society to the bottom, everyone now lives as if under constant hostile surveillance. People no longer ask themselves: What do I actually want? What suits my character? What would let the best in me develop? Instead they ask: What is expected of someone in my position? What do people like me usually do? Or worse: what do people above me usually do?

This is not a matter of people choosing convention over personal preference. The deeper problem is that it no longer occurs to them to have a personal preference. The mind itself has submitted. Even in leisure and pleasure, conformity comes first. Unusual taste is avoided as carefully as crime. People follow prescribed patterns so thoroughly and for so long that eventually they have no nature left to follow -- no strong desires, no independent opinions, no feelings they can genuinely call their own.

Is this really what we want human life to look like?","In some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, too much ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining and controlling them. There has been a time when the element of spontaneity and individuality was in excess, and the social principle had a hard struggle with it. The difficulty then was, to induce men of strong bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to control their impulses. To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline, like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power over the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his character—which society had not found any other sufficient means of binding. But society has now fairly got the better of individuality; and the danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences. Things are vastly changed, since the passions of those who were strong by station or by personal endowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws and ordinances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the persons within their reach to enjoy any particle of security. In our times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, every one lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. Not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual or the family do not ask themselves—what do I prefer? or, what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the best and highest in me to have fair play, and enable it to grow and thrive? They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstances superior to mine? I do not mean that they choose what is customary, in preference to what suits their own inclination. It does not occur to them to have any inclination, except for what is customary. Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of; they like in crowds; they exercise choice only among things commonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunned equally with crimes: until by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to follow: their human capacities are withered and starved: they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own. Now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature?",,"There was a time when individual energy genuinely threatened social order, and authority had to claim control over the whole person just to maintain peace. That era is finished. Society has won its war against individuality so completely that the danger has reversed. The threat now is not excess of personal impulse but its near-total absence. People no longer ask what they want -- they ask what is expected. Not because they choose convention over preference, but because it no longer occurs to them to have a preference. They conform in their pleasures, avoid unusual taste as carefully as crime, and follow prescribed patterns until no independent nature remains. Is this really the human condition we want?","In earlier times, unchecked individual energy threatened social order. But society has now won that battle so completely that the opposite danger prevails: people no longer develop independent desires or opinions. They conform automatically, not by choice but because genuine personal preference has atrophied. The result is a population without strong wishes, original feelings, or authentic character.",Society once struggled to restrain individuality; now it has so thoroughly succeeded that people no longer even know what they want.,3,6,,,,,"Popes struggling against the Emperors -- refers to the Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) and the broader medieval conflict between papal authority and the Holy Roman Emperors over the right to control appointments and governance. Mill uses this as an example of institutions claiming total authority over individuals in order to maintain social order. Mill's description of living 'under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship' anticipates concepts later developed by Michel Foucault regarding surveillance and self-discipline (Discipline and Punish, 1975)."
3.7,,,,"Calvinism offers the theological foundation for this suppression. The fundamental human sin is self-will. All good consists in obedience. Whatever is not a duty is a sin. Human nature is radically corrupt and must be destroyed within you. Crushing any human faculty is no loss -- you need only the ability to surrender to God's will.

This is the strict Calvinist position. But a softened version is far more widespread, held by many who would reject the label. The softening allows that God might want people to enjoy some inclinations -- but only as authority prescribes, and prescribed identically for everyone.","It is so, on the Calvinistic theory. According to that, the one great offence of man is self-will. All the good of which humanity is capable, is comprised in obedience. You have no choice; thus you must do, and no otherwise: “whatever is not a duty is a sin.” Human nature being radically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature is killed within him. To one holding this theory of life, crushing out any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no evil: man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the will of God: and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without them. This is the theory of Calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated form, by many who do not consider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will of God; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer, but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the same for all.",,"Calvinism provides the theological scaffolding for the suppression of individuality. Its core doctrine: the fundamental human sin is self-will. Whatever is not a duty is a sin. Human nature is corrupt and must be killed within you. Under this logic, crushing any human capacity is no loss -- you need only the ability to obey. Many who would reject the Calvinist label hold a diluted version of the same view: people may enjoy some inclinations, but only as authority prescribes, and prescribed identically for all.","Calvinism holds that self-will is the fundamental sin, human nature is corrupt, and all good lies in obedience. While few today embrace this doctrine fully, a softened version -- where people may enjoy life but only in ways prescribed uniformly by authority -- is far more widespread than recognized.",The Calvinist doctrine that self-will is sin and obedience is the only virtue survives in diluted form wherever conformity is treated as a moral imperative.,3,7,,,,,"Calvinism -- the theological tradition founded by John Calvin (1509-1564), emphasizing total depravity, unconditional election, and the absolute sovereignty of God. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536) established the doctrine of human nature's radical corruption. Mill's phrase 'whatever is not a duty is a sin' paraphrases a common Calvinist formulation. Mill is not attacking all Christianity but specifically the strand of Protestant theology that treats human desire itself as inherently sinful."
3.8,,,,"This cramped vision of human life persists in subtler forms. Many people genuinely believe that stunted human beings are what God intended -- the way some gardeners prefer trees clipped into geometric shapes over those growing as nature made them.

But if we were made by a good being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe our faculties were given to be developed, not rooted out. A good creator would delight in every step toward the ideal embedded in our nature.

There is a tradition of human excellence deeper than Calvinism: the Greek ideal of self-development, which does not oppose Christian self-governance but blends with it. It may be better to be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better still to be a Pericles than either -- possessing everything good in Knox without sacrificing the full development of human capacity.","In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of human character which it patronizes. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of animals, than as nature made them. But if it be any part of religion to believe that man was made by a good Being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties that they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. There is a different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to be abnegated. “Pagan self-assertion” is one of the elements of human worth, as well as “Christian self-denial.”
*7 There is a Greek ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of self-government blends with, but does not supersede.

3.9,,,,"It is not by grinding down everything individual in themselves but by cultivating it -- within the limits set by others' rights -- that people become something worth admiring. And as the character of the maker shapes the work, cultivating individuality enriches not only the person but all of human life, making it more diverse, more vivid, and more worth participating in.

As individuality develops, each person becomes more valuable to themselves and therefore more valuable to others. More life in the parts means more life in the whole. Of course, some restraint is necessary to prevent the strong from trampling others' rights. But this restraint is not a pure loss. The development sacrificed by being prevented from harming others is development gained largely at others' expense anyway. And learning to respect others' rights develops the social dimension of your own nature -- a genuine gain.

The critical distinction is this: being restrained from injuring others develops something real. Being restrained from doing things that do not affect others at all -- restrained merely because others disapprove -- develops nothing except perhaps the strength to resist the restraint itself. If you simply submit, it dulls your entire nature.

For human nature to have fair play, different people must be allowed to lead different lives. Every age that has permitted this latitude has been remembered by posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects as long as individuality survives beneath it. And whatever crushes individuality is despotism, regardless of what name it takes or whose will it claims to enforce.","It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others. There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is composed of them. As much compression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means of development which the individual loses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of other people. And even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of others, developes the feelings and capacities which have the good of others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by their mere displeasure, developes nothing valuable, except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint. If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any fair play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons should be allowed to lead different lives. In proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men.",,"People become admirable not by grinding down what is individual in themselves but by cultivating it within the limits of others' rights.

Different people must be allowed to lead different lives. Every age that has permitted this has been remembered. And whatever crushes individuality is despotism, no matter what name it wears.","Individuality, cultivated within the limits of others' rights, enriches both the person and society. Restraint that prevents harm to others is a fair trade, but restraint based on mere disapproval develops nothing and dulls human nature. Whatever crushes individuality is despotism, regardless of what it calls itself.","Whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called and whether it claims to enforce the will of God or the preferences of men.",3,9,,,,,"Mill draws a distinction that becomes central to his harm principle: restraint that prevents injury to others is legitimate and even developmental, while restraint based on mere social disapproval is destructive. This passage anticipates the detailed framework of Chapter 4, where Mill specifies the boundary between self-regarding and other-regarding conduct."
3.10,,,,"The argument could rest here. Individuality is development, and what better can be said of any condition than that it helps people become the best they can be?

But this will not convince those who most need convincing. People who do not value liberty for themselves must be shown that they benefit when others exercise it -- that tolerating others' freedom pays dividends even to those who would never use such freedom themselves.","Having said that individuality is the same thing with development, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument: for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations will not suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to the undeveloped—to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without hindrance.",,Individuality is development. What better can be said of any condition than that it helps people become the best they can be? But this argument will not move those who most need moving. People who do not want liberty for themselves must be shown -- in terms they recognize -- that they benefit when others exercise it freely.,The case for individuality as essential to human development could stand on its own. But those who do not value liberty need practical proof that they benefit when others are free to develop themselves fully.,The strongest case for liberty is that it produces the best human beings -- but the people who most need convincing require proof in practical terms.,3,10,,,,,Mill shifts his rhetorical strategy here from the intrinsic argument (individuality is good in itself because it constitutes human development) to the instrumental argument (individuality benefits even those who do not exercise it). This pivot reflects Mill's utilitarian framework -- he knows that some readers will respond only to arguments about collective benefit.
3.11,,,,"Start with the obvious: original people have something to teach the rest of us. The world always needs people who discover new truths, identify when old truths have expired, pioneer better practices, and model more thoughtful ways of living. No one who believes the world is still improvable can deny this.

Only a few people's experiments in living would actually improve on established practice if widely adopted. But those few are the salt of the earth. Without them, human life would stagnate. They do not only create what is new -- they keep what already exists alive. Without a succession of original minds revisiting the foundations of our beliefs and practices, the grounds for those beliefs become merely traditional, and dead tradition cannot survive the first serious challenge. Civilization itself could die out, as it did in the Byzantine Empire.

Geniuses will always be a minority. But to have them at all, you must preserve the conditions in which they can grow. Genius requires an atmosphere of freedom. By definition, people of genius are more individual than others -- less able to squeeze themselves without damage into the limited molds society offers. If they consent out of timidity to be compressed into those molds, society gains little from their genius. If they are strong enough to break free, society labels them 'wild,' 'erratic,' 'unstable' -- as absurd as complaining that Niagara Falls does not flow smoothly between its banks like a canal.","In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might possibly learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways and practices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being rendered by everybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. But these few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already existed. If there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect cease to be necessary? Would it be a reason why those who do the old things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings? There is only too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilization should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. Persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow. Genius can only breathe freely in an
atmosphere of freedom. Persons of genius are,
ex vi termini, more individual than any other people—less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning as “wild,” “erratic,” and the like; much as if one should complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a Dutch canal.",,"Original people have something to teach the rest of us -- they discover new truths, identify when old ones have expired, and model better ways of living.

If they break free, society calls them wild and erratic -- as absurd as complaining that Niagara Falls will not flow quietly like a canal.","Society always needs original thinkers to discover new truths, retire old ones, and keep existing knowledge vital.

The Eastern Roman Empire persisted until 1453 but was widely regarded by Victorian historians as culturally static after its early centuries.

3.12,,,,"People admire genius when it produces a brilliant novel or a striking painting. But genius in its true sense -- originality in thought and action -- is something nearly everyone secretly believes they can do without. This is unsurprising. Originality is the one thing that unoriginal minds cannot see the use of. If they could grasp what it would do for them, it would not be originality -- the whole point is that it reveals what conventional thinking cannot.

The first service originality performs is to open people's eyes. Once that is accomplished, they have a chance of becoming original themselves. In the meantime, given that every good thing that exists was once someone's original idea, the least people can do is acknowledge that originality still has work to do. And here is the deepest irony: the less conscious you are of needing originality, the more you need it.","I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory, but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally indifferent to it. People think genius a fine thing if it enables a man to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture. But in its true sense, that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it is not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do very well without it. Unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at. Originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use of. They cannot see what it is to do for them: how should they? If they could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. The first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening their eyes: which being once fully done, they would have a chance of being themselves original. Meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever yet done which some one was not the first to do, and that all good things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest enough to believe that there is something still left for it to accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of originality, the less they are conscious of the want.",,"People admire genius when it produces a great novel or painting, but genius in its true sense -- originality in thought and action -- is something nearly everyone believes they can live without. This is inevitable. Originality is the one thing unoriginal minds cannot see the use of. If they could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality.

3.13,,,,"Whatever lip service is paid to intellectual superiority, the dominant force in the world is mediocrity. In ancient and medieval times, a talented or powerful individual could be a force in their own right. Today, individuals are lost in the crowd. Public opinion rules. The only real power is mass power, and governments survive only by channeling the instincts of the majority.

This is true in private life as much as in politics. The people whose views constitute 'public opinion' vary by country -- but they are always a mass, which is to say, a collective mediocrity. And increasingly, this mass does not even take its opinions from leaders, thinkers, or books. Its thinking is done by people just like its members, speaking through media in real time, reacting in the moment.

This is not necessarily a complaint. Given the current state of human development, mass governance may be unavoidable. But mediocre governance is still mediocre. No democracy or large ruling class has ever risen above mediocrity except when it allowed itself to be guided by more gifted individuals. Every wise or noble initiative originates with individuals -- usually a single person. The honor of the average person is that they can recognize and follow such leadership with their eyes open.

This is not an argument for authoritarian hero-worship. The genius can claim only the freedom to point the way. Compelling others to follow is both destructive to their development and corrupting to the leader. But precisely because mass opinion is becoming the dominant force everywhere, the counterweight must be a more pronounced individuality among those capable of it. In an era when conformity is the default, even the bare act of nonconformity -- the simple refusal to follow custom unthinkingly -- is a public service.

Eccentricity has always flourished wherever strength of character flourished, and the amount of eccentricity in a society has always been proportional to its genius, intellectual energy, and moral courage. That so few people today dare to be eccentric is the chief danger of our time.","In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind. In ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishing degree through the long transition from feudality to the present time, the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either great talents or a high social position, he was a considerable power. At present individuals are lost in the crowd. In politics it is almost a triviality to say that public opinion now rules the world. The only power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of masses. This is as true in the moral and social relations of private life as in public transactions. Those whose opinions go by the name of public opinion, are not always the same sort of public: in America they are the whole white population; in England, chiefly the middle class. But they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity. And what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions from dignitaries in Church or State, from ostensible leaders, or from books. Their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves, addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment, through the newspapers. I am not complaining of all this. I do not assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the present low state of the human mind. But that does not hinder the government of mediocrity from being mediocre government. No government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign Many have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few. The initiation of all wise or noble things, comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some one individual. The honour and glory of the average man is that he is capable of following that initiative; that he can respond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open. I am not countenancing the sort of “hero-worship” which applauds the strong man of genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and making it do his bidding in spite of itself. All he can claim is, freedom to point out the way. The power of compelling others into it, is not only inconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, but corrupting to the strong man himself. It does seem, however, that when the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or becoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those who stand on the higher eminences of thought. It is in these circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead of being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the mass. In other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unless they acted not only differently, but better. In this age, the mere example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom, is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.",,"The dominant force in the world is mediocrity. In earlier ages, a gifted individual could be a power in themselves. Today, individuals are lost in the crowd, and public opinion rules through sheer mass.

No democracy has ever risen above mediocrity except when it let itself be guided by exceptional individuals. Every great initiative begins with one person. The genius can claim only the freedom to point the way -- never to compel. But when conformity is the reigning power, even the bare act of nonconformity becomes a service. Eccentricity has always been proportional to genius, vigor, and moral courage in a society.

The scarcity of eccentricity in a society signals its deepest danger.",That so few people now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of our time.,3,13,,,,,"Mill's analysis of public opinion anticipates Tocqueville's concept of the 'tyranny of the majority' -- indeed, Mill had reviewed Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1835/1840) and was deeply influenced by it. The 'hero-worship' Mill distances himself from refers to Thomas Carlyle's On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1841), which argued that great individuals are the driving force of history. Mill agrees that progress requires exceptional individuals but insists they must lead by persuasion, never by coercion. Mill's observation about newspapers doing people's thinking anticipates later media criticism by Walter Lippmann (Public Opinion, 1922) and Noam Chomsky."
3.14,,,,"Encouraging unconventional ways of living is important partly because some of them may prove worth adopting widely. But that is not the only reason, and it is not just exceptionally talented people who have a right to live on their own terms.

There is no reason all human lives should be built on one pattern, or even a few. If a person has reasonable sense and experience, their own way of arranging their life is the best way -- not because it is objectively superior, but because it is theirs. People are not interchangeable. You cannot even buy a well-fitting coat off the rack without either custom tailoring or a vast selection. Is fitting a life to a person somehow easier than fitting a coat?

People differ in what gives them pleasure and what causes them pain. The same conditions that energize one person crush another. The same way of life that keeps one person's faculties sharp drives another into stagnation. Without a corresponding diversity of lifestyles, people neither achieve their fair share of happiness nor develop to their full mental, moral, and aesthetic potential.

Yet social tolerance extends only to preferences held by enough people to avoid suppression. You may freely like or dislike sports, music, or card games -- because both sides are too numerous to silence. But anyone accused of doing 'what nobody does' or failing to do 'what everybody does' is treated as if they had committed a moral offense. Only wealth, status, or institutional protection allows people to live as they choose without paying a social price. And even then, the latitude is narrow. Push too far and you risk more than disapproval -- in Mill's time, you could face legal proceedings to declare you insane and have your property seized by relatives.","I have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of these are fit to be converted into customs. But independence of action, and disregard of custom, are not solely deserving of encouragement for the chance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthy of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives in their own way. There is no reason that all human existence should be constructed on some one or some small number of patterns. If a person possesses any tolerable amount of common sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode. Human beings are not like sheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike. A man cannot get a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easier to fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like one another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in the shape of their feet? If it were only that people have diversities of taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after one model. But different persons also require different conditions for their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical, atmosphere and climate. The same things which are helps to one person towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another. The same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his faculties of action and enjoyment in their best order, while to another it is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal life. Such are the differences among human beings in their sources of pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable. Why then should tolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only to tastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude of their adherents? Nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame, either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athletic exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be put down. But the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused either of doing “what nobody does,” or of not doing “what everybody does,” is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had committed some grave moral delinquency. Persons require to possess a title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like without detriment to their estimation. To indulge somewhat, I repeat: for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of something worse than disparaging speeches—they are in peril of a commission
de lunatico, and of having their property taken from them and given to their relations.",,"Not every unconventional life will prove superior, but that is not the point. There is no reason all lives should follow one pattern. If you have reasonable judgment, your own way of living is the best -- not because it is objectively better, but because it is yours. You cannot buy a well-fitting coat without tailoring or vast selection. Is a life easier to fit than a coat? What energizes one person crushes another.

3.F8,,,,"There is something both contemptible and frightening about how easily a person can be legally declared unfit to manage their own affairs. After death, their will can be overturned if the estate is large enough to justify the legal costs -- costs charged to the estate itself, creating a perverse incentive. Every detail of the person's daily life is scrutinized, and anything that looks unusual through the lens of the most unimaginative observers is presented to a jury as evidence of insanity -- often successfully. The jurors are no more sophisticated than the witnesses, and the judges, displaying an astonishing ignorance of human nature, frequently help mislead them.

These trials reveal the depth of public hostility toward individual freedom. Far from respecting the right of each person to act according to their own judgment in matters that affect no one else, judges and juries cannot even conceive that a sane person would want such freedom. In earlier times, when it was proposed to burn atheists, charitable people suggested putting them in asylums instead. It would hardly be surprising today to see the same approach -- with the perpetrators congratulating themselves on their humane, Christian treatment of these unfortunates, quietly satisfied that the mad-house serves as punishment just as well.","8.
There is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort of evidence on which, of late years, any person can be judicially declared unfit for the management of his affairs; and after his death, his disposal of his property can be set aside, if there is enough of it to pay the expenses of litigation—which are charged on the property itself. All of the minute details of his daily life are pried into, and whatever is found which, seen through the medium of the perceiving and describing faculties of the lowest of the low, bears an appearance unlike absolute commonplace, is laid before the jury as evidence of insanity, and often with success; the jurors being little, if at all, less vulgar and ignorant than the witnesses; while the judges, with that extraordinary want of knowledge of human nature and life which continually astonishes us in English lawyers, often help to mislead them. These trials speak volumes as to the state of feeling and opinion among the vulgar with regard to human liberty. So far from setting any value on individuality—so far from respecting the right of each individual to act, in things indifferent, as seems good to his own judgment and inclinations, judges and juries cannot even conceive that a person in a state of sanity can desire such freedom. In former days, when it was proposed to burn atheists, charitable people used to suggest putting them in a mad-house instead: it would be nothing surprising now-a-days were we to see this done, and the doers applauding themselves, because, instead of persecuting for religion, they had adopted so humane and Christian a mode of treating these unfortunates, not without a silent satisfaction at their having thereby obtained their deserts.",,"The ease with which a person can be declared legally insane reveals how deeply society distrusts individual freedom.

3.15,,,,"There is a feature of contemporary public opinion that makes it especially hostile to individuality. Most people are moderate not only in intellect but in their desires. They have no wishes strong enough to push them toward anything unusual, and they cannot understand people who do. They classify anyone with strong inclinations alongside the reckless and undisciplined.

Add to this baseline intolerance a strong social movement toward moral improvement -- exactly the kind that prevails today, with its emphasis on regularity, restraint, and the philanthropic reformation of others -- and the pressure to conform intensifies dramatically. The public becomes more willing than ever to prescribe general rules of conduct and enforce a single approved standard.

That standard, whether stated or implied, is to want nothing strongly. Its ideal of character is to have no marked character at all -- to compress every part of human nature that stands out, the way foot-binding deforms what grows naturally, until the person conforms to the smooth outline of the ordinary.","There is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion, peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration of individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderate in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon. Now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to suppose that a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals, and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movement has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our fellow-creatures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved standard. And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing strongly. Its ideal of character is to be without any marked character; to maim by compression, like a Chinese lady’s foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity.",,"Most people are moderate in both intellect and desire.

Mill uses it as a metaphor for the deliberate deformation of human nature through enforced conformity.

Already energetic characters on any large scale are becoming merely traditional. There is now scarcely any outlet for energy in this country except business. The energy expended in this may still be regarded as considerable. What little is left from that employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing of small dimensions.

The concern that individual initiative was being replaced by organizational capacity was shared by Carlyle, Arnold, and Ruskin.

3.17,,,,"The tyranny of custom is the permanent obstacle to human progress. It stands in constant opposition to every impulse toward something better -- whether that impulse is called the spirit of liberty, the spirit of progress, or the spirit of improvement.

These spirits are related but not identical. The spirit of improvement sometimes tries to force progress on unwilling people, and the spirit of liberty may temporarily ally with opponents of improvement to resist such coercion. But the only reliable and permanent source of improvement is liberty, because liberty creates as many independent centers of innovation as there are free individuals.

The contest between custom and progress is the central drama of human history. Most of the world, strictly speaking, has no history at all, because custom won completely. Throughout much of Asia and the Middle East, custom became the final authority on everything -- justice, right, conduct. The result is visible. These civilizations were once the most advanced on earth. They invented writing, agriculture, architecture, and governance while the ancestors of modern Europeans wandered in forests. But they stopped progressing. When? When they ceased to possess individuality.

If Europe faces a similar fate, it will take a different form. The threat is not stagnation in the traditional sense. Modern Western societies proscribe uniqueness but embrace change -- so long as everyone changes together. Fashion shifts constantly, but everyone must follow the same fashion. We adopt new technologies but discard them on schedule. We pursue improvement in politics, education, even morals -- though moral improvement mostly means persuading or forcing others to be more like us.

We do not object to progress. We object to individuality. We would consider it an achievement to make everyone alike, forgetting that it is precisely the differences between people that reveal the limitations of any single type and point toward something better.

China stands as the cautionary example. A nation of considerable talent and even wisdom, equipped early on with an excellent set of customs designed by thinkers any civilization would respect, and possessing a sophisticated system for ensuring that the best-educated citizens occupy positions of authority. If any nation had discovered the formula for permanent progress, it was China. Instead, China became static for centuries, and any future improvement would have to come from outside influences.

China succeeded spectacularly at what modern conformist culture is working toward: making everyone think and act by the same rules. And these are the fruits. The modern regime of public opinion is, in disorganized form, what the Chinese system was in organized form. Unless individuality can assert itself against this pressure, the West, despite its heritage, will tend toward the same destination.","The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at something better than customary, which is called, according to circumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or improvement. The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement; but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals. The progressive principle, however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or of improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of Custom, involving at least emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes the chief interest of the history of mankind. The greater part of the world has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism of Custom is complete. This is the case over the whole East. Custom is there, in all things, the final appeal; justice and right mean conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting. And we see the result. Those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life; they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and most powerful nations of the world. What are they now? The subjects or dependents of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom custom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress. A people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and then stop: when does it stop? When it ceases to possess individuality. If a similar change should befall the nations of Europe, it will not be in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which these nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. It proscribes singularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change together. We have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every one must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change once or twice a year. We thus take care that when there is change it shall be for change’s sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience; for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at another moment. But we are progressive as well as changeable: we continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them until they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvement in politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our idea of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to be as good as ourselves. It is not progress that we object to; on the contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people who ever lived. It is individuality that we war against: we should think we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that the unlikeness of one person to another is generally the first thing which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type, and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the advantages of both, of producing something better than either. We have a warning example in China—a nation of much talent, and, in some respects, even wisdom, owing to the rare good fortune of having been provided at an early period with a particularly good set of customs, the work, in some measure, of men to whom even the most enlightened European must accord, under certain limitations, the title of sages and philosophers. They are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the best wisdom they possess upon every mind in the community, and securing that those who have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of honour and power. Surely the people who did this have discovered the secret of human progressiveness, and must have kept themselves steadily at the head of the movement of the world. On the contrary, they have become stationary—have remained so for thousands of years; and if they are ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners. They have succeeded beyond all hope in what English philanthropists are so industriously working at—in making a people all alike, all governing their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims and rules; and these are the fruits. The modern
régime of public opinion is, in an unorganized form, what the Chinese educational and political systems are in an organized; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding its noble antecedents and its professed Christianity, will tend to become another China.",,"The tyranny of custom is the standing obstacle to human advancement.

Modern historians view this framing as Eurocentric and factually oversimplified; China experienced significant internal change and innovation during periods Mill characterizes as static. The 'particularly good set of customs' refers to Confucian social philosophy, attributed to Confucius (551-479 BC) and his successors, particularly Mencius. The Chinese examination system (keju) for selecting government officials based on merit, operational from 605 to 1905 AD, is what Mill references regarding ensuring 'those who have appropriated most wisdom shall occupy the posts of honour and power.' Regime -- Mill uses the French term to describe the system of public opinion, possibly echoing Tocqueville's terminology. The passage also recalls Humboldt's two conditions for human development: freedom and variety of situations."
3.18,,,,"What has preserved Europe from the fate of civilizations that stagnated? Not any inherent superiority -- that, where it exists, is an effect, not a cause. What saved Europe was its remarkable diversity. Individuals, classes, and nations were profoundly unlike one another. They pursued radically different paths, each producing something valuable. Although they were often intolerant of one another, their attempts to suppress each other's development rarely succeeded permanently, and each eventually absorbed the good that others had to offer. Europe owes its progressive, many-sided development entirely to this plurality of paths.

But this advantage is eroding. Europe is already moving toward the ideal of making everyone alike. Tocqueville observed that the French of his day resembled one another far more than the previous generation. The same is true of every developed nation to an even greater degree.

Recall Humboldt's two conditions for human development: freedom and variety of circumstances. The second is disappearing rapidly. The conditions that once shaped different classes, regions, and professions into genuinely different worlds are dissolving. People increasingly consume the same media, visit the same places, share the same aspirations, enjoy the same rights, and possess the same means of asserting them. The remaining differences in social position are trivial compared to those that have vanished.

Every major trend accelerates this convergence. Political reform raises the low and lowers the high. Universal education brings everyone under the same influences. Improvements in communication and transportation keep people in constant contact. The expansion of commerce spreads opportunity widely, making ambition universal rather than class-specific. And most powerful of all, the complete dominance of public opinion eliminates every social position from which nonconformity could be safely practiced. As the platforms that once allowed individuals to disregard majority opinion are leveled, there ceases to be any institutional support for dissent -- any power in society with both the independence and the interest to protect unpopular views.","What is it that has hitherto preserved Europe from this lot? What has made the European family of nations an improving, instead of a stationary portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them, which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but their remarkable diversity of character and culture. Individuals, classes, nations, have been extremely unlike one another: they have struck out a great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and although at every period those who travelled in different paths have been intolerant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellent thing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road, their attempts to thwart each other’s development have rarely had any permanent success, and each has in time endured to receive the good which the others have offered. Europe is, in my judgment, wholly indebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sided development. But it already begins to possess this benefit in a considerably less degree. It is decidedly advancing towards the Chinese ideal of making all people alike. M. de Tocqueville, in his last important work, remarks how much more the Frenchmen of the present day resemble one another, than did those even of the last generation. The same remark might be made of Englishmen in a far greater degree. In a passage already quoted from Wilhelm von Humboldt, he points out two things as necessary conditions of human development, because necessary to render people unlike one another; namely, freedom, and variety of situations. The second of these two conditions is in this country every day diminishing. The circumstances which surround different classes and individuals, and shape their characters, are daily becoming more assimilated. Formerly, different ranks, different neighbourhoods, different trades and professions, lived in what might be called different worlds; at present, to a great degree in the same. Comparatively speaking, they now read the same things, listen to the same things, see the same things, go to the same places, have their hopes and fears directed to the same objects, have the same rights and liberties, and the same means of asserting them. Great as are the differences of position which remain, they are nothing to those which have ceased. And the assimilation is still proceeding. All the political changes of the age promote it, since they all tend to raise the low and to lower the high. Every extension of education promotes it, because education brings people under common influences, and gives them access to the general stock of facts and sentiments. Improvements in the means of communication promote it, by bringing the inhabitants of distant places into personal contact, and keeping up a rapid flow of changes of residence between one place and another. The increase of commerce and manufactures promotes it, by diffusing more widely the advantages of easy circumstances, and opening all objects of ambition, even the highest, to general competition, whereby the desire of rising becomes no longer the character of a particular class, but of all classes. A more powerful agency than even all these, in bringing about a general similarity among mankind, is the complete establishment, in this and other free countries, of the ascendancy of public opinion in the State. As the various social eminences which enabled persons entrenched on them to disregard the opinion of the multitude, gradually become levelled; as the very idea of resisting the will of the public, when it is positively known that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds of practical politicians; there ceases to be any social support for nonconformity—any substantive power in society, which, itself opposed to the ascendancy of numbers, is interested in taking under its protection opinions and tendencies at variance with those of the public.",,"What saved Europe from stagnation was not superiority but diversity. Individuals, classes, and nations were profoundly unlike one another, each pursuing different paths toward different things of value. Despite constant mutual intolerance, their attempts to suppress one another rarely succeeded permanently, and each absorbed the good the others produced.

Mill had been corresponding with Tocqueville and had reviewed Democracy in America for the London and Westminster Review (1835 and 1840). Wilhelm von Humboldt -- Mill returns to Humboldt's two conditions for development (freedom and variety of situations) first cited in passage 3.2.

He saw the mid-19th century as a critical juncture where democratic and industrial forces were powerful enough to enforce conformity but not yet so entrenched as to make resistance futile.

4.22,,,,"You do not sign a contract to join society, but you do owe something for its protection. Living among others creates two basic obligations: first, do not violate other people's rights; second, bear your fair share of the costs of maintaining the social order. Society can enforce both of these.

Beyond that, your behavior toward others can be hurtful without technically violating anyone's rights. In those cases, you are answerable to social opinion, though not to law. The moment your conduct materially affects other people's interests, society has jurisdiction. The question becomes whether intervening will do more good than harm.

But when your conduct affects no one but yourself -- or affects others only if they voluntarily involve themselves -- there should be complete freedom, both legal and social, to act and to live with the consequences.","Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person’s bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion, though not by law. As soon as any part of a person’s conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But there is no room for entertaining any such question when a person’s conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.",,"Society may compel you to respect others' rights and bear your share of common burdens. It may judge you by social opinion when your behavior harms others without breaking laws. But where your conduct touches no one's interests but your own, freedom should be absolute -- legal and social, without exception.","Living in society creates two enforceable obligations: respect others' rights and share the costs of collective defense. Beyond these, conduct affecting others is subject to social opinion. But conduct affecting only yourself demands complete freedom.","Society may enforce your obligations to others, but where your conduct affects only yourself, freedom should be absolute.",4,22,,,,,"Mill explicitly rejects social contract theory (Rousseau, Hobbes) while preserving its practical conclusions. The distinction between legal enforcement and social opinion enforcement is central to Mill's framework -- he recognizes both as forms of coercion but calibrates them differently. The parenthetical about 'full age and ordinary understanding' carves out exceptions for children and those with diminished capacity."
4.23,,,,"This is not a doctrine of selfish indifference. It does not say people should ignore each other's well-being. The opposite: we need far more genuine effort to help each other flourish. But benevolence has better tools than coercion -- persuasion, example, education, honest counsel.

You should absolutely tell someone you think they are making a mistake. You should argue, encourage, even press your case. What you may not do is force them. No one -- no individual, no majority -- is entitled to dictate to a competent adult what they shall do with their own life.

Why? Because you are the world's leading expert on your own circumstances. Society's interest in your private choices is marginal and indirect. When the public overrides your judgment about your own affairs, it acts on generalizations that may not apply to your case, wielded by people who know less about your situation than you do. You remain the final judge. Whatever mistakes you make on your own account are far less dangerous than the evil of letting others compel you toward their idea of your good.","It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beings have no business with each other’s conduct in life, and that they should not concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one another, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution, there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote the good of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instruments to persuade people to their good, than whips and scourges, either of the literal or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue the self-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even second, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivate both. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well as by compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period of education is past, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated. Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from the worse, and encouragement to choose the former and avoid the latter. They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise of their higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aims towards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objects and contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interest which any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment, can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; the interest which society has in him individually (except as to his conduct to others) is fractional, and altogether indirect: while, with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards himself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons no better acquainted with the circumstances of such cases than those are who look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, of human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the conduct of human beings towards one another, it is necessary that general rules should for the most part be observed, in order that people may know what they have to expect; but in each person’s own concerns, his individual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aid his judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him, even obtruded on him, by others; but he himself is the final judge. All errors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning, are far outweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what they deem his good.",,"Care for others, yes. Persuade them, argue with them, even press your case with urgency. But no one is authorized to dictate to a competent adult how they shall live. You are the foremost authority on your own life. The mistakes you make freely are less dangerous than the tyranny of others compelling you toward their vision of your good.","Mill's principle is not indifference -- it demands more persuasion and honest counsel, not less. But it draws an absolute line: no person or group may force a competent adult to live differently for their own supposed benefit. Each person knows their own circumstances better than any outsider can.","Persuade, argue, even plead -- but never compel a competent adult in matters that concern only themselves, because no one knows their situation better than they do.",4,23,,,,,"Mill distinguishes 'self-regarding virtues' (prudence, self-development) from 'social virtues' (duties to others), insisting both matter but only the latter may be enforced. The argument from epistemic superiority -- that individuals know their own circumstances better than outsiders -- is a proto-Hayekian insight about the limits of centralized knowledge, later developed by Friedrich Hayek in 'The Use of Knowledge in Society' (1945)."
4.24,,,,"None of this means you must pretend to admire someone whose life is a mess. If someone wastes their potential, you are free to think less of them. If they are reckless, self-destructive, or tasteless to a degree that repels you, you are free to feel and express that reaction. You can avoid their company. You can warn others about their influence. You can prefer other people over them for opportunities and attention.

These are natural consequences of their choices -- the organic social cost of living badly. They are not punishments deliberately imposed. There is a crucial difference between the world naturally responding to how you live and the world organizing to make you suffer for it.

Someone who is reckless with money, enslaved to short-term pleasures, or chronically unreliable must expect diminished regard from others. That is not injustice. It is simply the natural result of their choices -- and they have no standing to complain about it unless they have separately earned goodwill through their treatment of others.","I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others, ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualities or deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent in any of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, a proper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal perfection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, a sentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree of folly, and a degree of what may be called (though the phrase is not unobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it cannot justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him necessarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even of contempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strength without entertaining these feelings. Though doing no wrong to any one, a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as a fool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment and feeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him a service to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable consequence to which he exposes himself. It would be well, indeed, if this good office were much more freely rendered than the common notions of politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly point out to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered unmannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to act upon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of his individuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for example, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not to parade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society most acceptable to us. We have a right, and it may be our duty, to caution others against him, if we think his example or conversation likely to have a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffer very severe penalties at the hands of others, for faults which directly concern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as they are the natural, and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of the faults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him for the sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit—who cannot live within moderate means—who cannot restrain himself from hurtful indulgences—who pursues animal pleasures at the expense of those of feeling and intellect—must expect to be lowered in the opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable sentiments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has merited their favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thus established a title to their good offices, which is not affected by his demerits towards himself.",,"You are free to admire or disdain, to seek someone's company or avoid it, to warn others or withhold your favor. These are the natural social costs of living as one chooses. The line is between consequences that arise organically and punishments deliberately inflicted. The world may respond to how you live. It may not organize to make you suffer for it.","Others may naturally lose respect for someone who lives badly -- avoiding their company, warning others, preferring others for opportunities. These organic social consequences are legitimate. What is not legitimate is deliberately organizing punishment for purely self-regarding faults.",The natural social cost of living foolishly is legitimate; the deliberate imposition of punishment for purely personal choices is not.,4,24,,,,,"Mill carefully distinguishes 'natural consequences' (people organically losing respect) from 'imposed penalties' (society deliberately punishing self-regarding conduct). This distinction between spontaneous social feedback and organized coercion remains central to debates about cancel culture, social media shaming, and the boundaries of legitimate social disapproval."
4.25,,,,"The distinction I am drawing is this: for conduct that only harms yourself, you should face nothing worse than the natural withdrawal of others' esteem. For conduct that harms others, something entirely different is warranted.

Violating someone's rights, deceiving them, exploiting an unfair advantage, even failing to defend them when you could -- these are genuinely immoral acts deserving moral condemnation and, in serious cases, punishment. And the character traits behind such acts -- cruelty, malice, envy, dishonesty, the compulsion to dominate -- are properly called moral vices.

Self-destructive behavior is categorically different. It may show foolishness or a lack of self-respect, but it is not wicked. It becomes a moral matter only when it breaches a duty to someone else. What we call 'duties to ourselves' -- when they mean anything beyond common sense -- refer to self-respect and self-development. No one is accountable to others for these, because holding people accountable for them does not actually serve humanity's interests.","What I contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictly inseparable from the unfavourable judgment of others, are the only ones to which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of his conduct and character which concerns his own good, but which does not affect the interests of others in their relations with him. Acts injurious to others require a totally different treatment. Encroachment on their rights; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified by his own rights; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair or ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence from defending them against injury—these are fit objects of moral reprobation, and, in grave cases, of moral retribution and punishment. And not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, are properly immoral, and fit subjects of disapprobation which may rise to abhorrence. Cruelty of disposition; malice and ill-nature; that most anti-social and odious of all passions, envy; dissimulation and insincerity, irascibility on insufficient cause, and resentment disproportioned to the provocation; the love of domineering over others; the desire to engross more than one’s share of advantages (the
Greek, pleonesia of the Greeks); the pride which derives gratification from the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self and its concerns more important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questions in its own favour;—these are moral vices, and constitute a bad and odious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previously mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitch they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness. They may be proofs of any amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self-respect; but they are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breach of duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have care for himself. What are called duties to ourselves are not socially obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same time duties to others. The term duty to oneself, when it means anything more than prudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of these is any one accountable to his fellow creatures, because for none of them is it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable to them.",,"Cruelty, malice, dishonesty, the lust to dominate -- these are moral vices because they harm others. Self-destruction may be foolish, even pitiful, but it is not wicked. It crosses into immorality only when it breaches a duty to someone else. No one owes the world an account of their self-respect.","Mill draws a sharp line: conduct harming others (rights violations, deception, cruelty) is genuinely immoral and punishable. Self-destructive conduct may be foolish but is not wicked. It becomes a moral matter only when it breaches obligations to others.","Self-destruction is folly, not wickedness -- it becomes immoral only when it violates a duty owed to others.",4,25,,,,,"Pleonexia (Greek) -- the desire to have more than one's fair share, a concept from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (Book V). Mill's taxonomy of moral vices (cruelty, envy, dishonesty, domination) versus self-regarding faults (foolishness, lack of self-respect) parallels the Stoic distinction between moral and non-moral failings. The concept of 'duties to oneself' traces to Kant's Metaphysics of Morals (1797), which Mill here partly rejects."
4.26,,,,"This is not a technical distinction. It fundamentally changes how we should feel and act toward someone.

When someone's private choices displease you, you may express your distaste and keep your distance. But you should not set out to make their life worse. They are already paying the price of their mistakes. If someone ruins their life through poor judgment, piling on additional punishment is pointless cruelty. Instead of anger, the proper response is something closer to pity -- perhaps concern, perhaps honest counsel, but never organized hostility. The worst that is justified is leaving them alone.

When someone violates other people's rights, the calculus reverses entirely. The harm falls on others, and society must respond -- deliberately, proportionally, and with the express purpose of deterrence and justice. In this case, we are not merely bystanders with opinions. We are judges obligated to act.","The distinction between the loss of consideration which a person may rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and the reprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights of others, is not a merely nominal distinction. It makes a vast difference both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he displeases us in things in which we think we have a right to control him, or in things in which we know that we have not. If he displeases us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel called on to make his life uncomfortable. We shall reflect that he already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he spoils his life by mismanagement, we shall not, for that reason, desire to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall rather endeavour to alleviate his punishment, by showing him how he may avoid or cure the evils his conduct tends to bring upon him. He may be to us an object of pity, perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or resentment; we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worst we shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself, if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for him. It is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for the protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively. The evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on others; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliate on him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment, and must take care that it be sufficiently severe. In the one case, he is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering on him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the same liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in his.",,"When someone harms only themselves, the proper response is pity, distance, perhaps honest counsel -- never organized hostility. They already bear the cost of their own errors. But when someone violates the rights of others, society must act with deliberate purpose: to deter, to protect, to deliver justice.","The distinction between self-regarding and other-regarding faults changes everything about the proper response. For self-harming conduct: sympathy, distance, and honest advice. For harm to others: deliberate social and legal consequences, proportionally enforced.","Someone who harms only themselves deserves pity, not punishment; someone who harms others demands a deliberate response from society.",4,26,,,,,"Mill's framework here anticipates restorative justice principles -- the idea that punishment should be proportional and purposive, not retaliatory. The distinction between 'natural penalties' and 'imposed penalties' remains a live issue in criminal justice philosophy."
4.27,,,,"Now for the strongest objection: 'No one is an island. Every act of self-destruction ripples outward. If you wreck your health, your dependents suffer. If you squander your money, your creditors lose. If you let your abilities decay, society loses what you could have contributed. And even if the direct damage stays contained, your bad example corrupts others. So there is no such thing as purely self-regarding conduct.'

This is the most serious challenge to the principle I have laid out, and it deserves a serious answer.","The distinction here pointed out between the part of a person’s life which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, many persons will refuse to admit. How (it may be asked) can any part of the conduct of a member of society be a matter of indifference to the other members? No person is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for a person to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself, without mischief reaching at least to his near connexions, and often far beyond them. If he injures his property, he does harm to those who directly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes, by a greater or less amount, the general resources of the community. If he deteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil upon all who depended on him for any portion of their happiness, but disqualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to his fellow-creatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affection or benevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly any offence that is committed would detract more from the general sum of good. Finally, if by his vices or follies a person does no direct harm to others, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example; and ought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whom the sight or knowledge of his conduct might corrupt or mislead.",,"The strongest objection: no one is truly isolated. Every act of self-destruction sends ripples outward -- to dependents, creditors, communities. If harm always radiates, can any conduct be purely personal?","Mill presents the strongest counterargument to his principle: since no person is truly isolated, all self-destructive behavior harms others indirectly -- through dependents, lost contributions, and corrupting example. This challenges the very existence of 'purely self-regarding' conduct.",The most powerful objection to individual liberty is that no act of self-destruction is truly self-contained -- its consequences always radiate outward.,4,27,,,,,"The objection Mill voices here -- 'no man is an island' -- echoes John Donne's Meditation XVII (1624). This communitarian argument recurs throughout political philosophy, from Aristotle's conception of humans as inherently social beings to modern communitarians like Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor."
4.28,,,,"The objection continues: 'And if we protect children from their own bad judgment, why not protect adults who are equally incapable of self-governance? If gambling, addiction, laziness, and neglect are as destructive as many crimes, why should law and social opinion not suppress them with equal force? This is not about stifling individuality or blocking experiments in living. These are not new experiments -- they are old failures. Humanity has run these experiments for thousands of years and the results are in. We are simply trying to prevent each generation from walking off the same cliff.'","And even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could be confined to the vicious or thoughtless individual, ought society to abandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? If protection against themselves is confessedly due to children and persons under age, is not society equally bound to afford it to persons of mature years who are equally incapable of self-government? If gambling, or drunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as injurious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as many or most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should not law, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience, endeavour to repress these also? And as a supplement to the unavoidable imperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organize a powerful police against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penalties those who are known to practise them? There is no question here (it may be said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the trial of new and original experiments in living. The only things it is sought to prevent are things which have been tried and condemned from the beginning of the world until now; things which experience has shown not to be useful or suitable to any person’s individuality. There must be some length of time and amount of experience, after which a moral or prudential truth may be regarded as established: and it is merely desired to prevent generation after generation from falling over the same precipice which has been fatal to their predecessors.",,"If we protect children from their own folly, why not adults who are equally reckless? These are not bold experiments in living -- they are ancient mistakes with known outcomes. Why let each generation discover the same cliff by falling off it?","The paternalist argument extends: if society protects children, why not reckless adults? Gambling, addiction, and idleness are proven harms, not novel experiments. Society is merely trying to prevent the repetition of ancient and well-documented failures.","The paternalist asks: if these are not new experiments but old failures with known outcomes, why should society stand by while people repeat them?",4,28,,,,,"Mill is steelmanning the paternalist position before dismantling it. The argument about 'experiments already tried and condemned' challenges Mill's own language from Chapter 3 about 'experiments in living.' The tension between respecting individual choice and preventing well-documented harm remains central to policy debates about drugs, gambling, and public health."
4.29,,,,"I grant the premise: self-destructive conduct can genuinely harm others. But the critical question is what exactly we are punishing.

When your private habits cause you to default on a real obligation -- you cannot pay your debts, you cannot support your family, you cannot perform your professional duties -- you are rightly held accountable. But the offense is the broken obligation, not the private behavior. If a parent neglects their children because of a gambling addiction, we condemn the neglect. If they neglected their children because they poured all their resources into a perfectly sensible investment that failed, the moral failure would be identical. The private cause is irrelevant; the breach of duty is what matters.

Similarly, no one should be punished simply for being drunk. But a surgeon should be disciplined for operating while impaired. An air traffic controller should lose their job for showing up intoxicated. The offense is not the drinking -- it is the failure to meet a specific duty to others.

The rule is clean: wherever there is definite harm or definite risk of harm to another person or the public, the matter leaves the domain of liberty and enters the domain of morality and law.","I fully admit that the mischief which a person does to himself may seriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests, those nearly connected with him, and in a minor degree, society at large. When, by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate a distinct and assignable obligation to any other person or persons, the case is taken out of the self-regarding class, and becomes amenable to moral disapprobation in the proper sense of the term. If, for example, a man, through intemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay his debts, or, having undertaken the moral responsibility of a family, becomes from the same cause incapable of supporting or educating them, he is deservedly reprobated, and might be justly punished; but it is for the breach of duty to his family or creditors, not for the extravagance. If the resources which ought to have been devoted to them, had been diverted from them for the most prudent investment, the moral culpability would have been the same. George Barnwell murdered his uncle to get money for his mistress, but if he had done it to set himself up in business, he would equally have been hanged. Again, in the frequent case of a man who causes grief to his family by addiction to bad habits, he deserves reproach for his unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may for cultivating habits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to those with whom he passes his life, or who from personal ties are dependent on him for their comfort. Whoever fails in the consideration generally due to the interests and feelings of others, not being compelled by some more imperative duty, or justified by allowable self-preference, is a subject of moral disapprobation for that failure, but not for the cause of it, nor for the errors, merely personal to himself, which may have remotely led to it. In like manner, when a person disables himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the performance of some definite duty incumbent on him to the public, he is guilty of a social offence. No person ought to be punished simply for being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should be punished for being drunk on duty. Whenever, in short, there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to the public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in that of morality or law.",,"Grant the premise: self-destruction can ripple outward. But we punish the broken obligation, not the private cause. A parent who neglects their children is culpable for the neglect -- whether the cause was addiction, reckless investment, or sheer indifference. A surgeon operating impaired is punished for endangering patients, not for drinking. The breach of duty is the offense; the private behavior behind it is not.","Mill concedes that self-destructive behavior can harm others, but insists the punishable offense is always the breach of duty, never the private behavior itself. A person should not be punished for drinking, but should be punished for failing to meet obligations while impaired.","Punish the broken obligation, not the private behavior behind it -- the breach of duty is the offense, regardless of its cause.",4,29,,,,,"George Barnwell -- protagonist of George Lillo's play The London Merchant (1731), who murders his uncle for money. Mill uses this literary example to show that the crime (murder) is the same regardless of motive. The surgeon/controller examples update Mill's original soldier/policeman illustrations. The principle that liability attaches to the breach of duty rather than its underlying cause remains foundational in tort law."
4.30,,,,"As for the indirect, speculative harm that self-destructive behavior might cause society -- the vague possibility that someone's bad habits will somehow diminish the general welfare -- that cost is one a free society must accept. The alternative is worse.

Besides, society already had its chance. It controlled the entire upbringing of every citizen -- childhood education, cultural norms, social conditioning. If after all that, some people still make poor choices, the answer is not to add coercion on top. It is to do a better job of educating the next generation. A society that fails at education and then resorts to compulsion in private life is admitting its own failure and doubling down on the wrong solution.

And coercion in private matters actively backfires. People with any strength of character will rebel against it on principle. They will do the opposite of what is demanded, ostentatiously, as a badge of independence -- the way the licentiousness of the Restoration era was a direct reaction to Puritan moral tyranny.

Finally, there is the 'bad example' objection -- that self-destructive people corrupt others by their example. But think it through: if the behavior truly leads to ruin, the example includes the ruin. People can see the consequences. A visible cautionary tale does more to deter than any ban.","But with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called, constructive injury which a person causes to society, by conduct which neither violates any specific duty to the public, nor occasions perceptible hurt to any assignable individual except himself; the inconvenience is one which society can afford to bear, for the sake of the greater good of human freedom. If grown persons are to be punished for not taking proper care of themselves, I would rather it were for their own sake, than under pretence of preventing them from impairing their capacity of rendering to society benefits which society does not pretend it has a right to exact. But I cannot consent to argue the point as if society had no means of bringing its weaker members up to its ordinary standard of rational conduct, except waiting till they do something irrational, and then punishing them, legally or morally, for it. Society has had absolute power over them during all the early portion of their existence: it has had the whole period of childhood and nonage in which to try whether it could make them capable of rational conduct in life. The existing generation is master both of the training and the entire circumstances of the generation to come; it cannot indeed make them perfectly wise and good, because it is itself so lamentably deficient in goodness and wisdom; and its best efforts are not always, in individual cases, its most successful ones; but it is perfectly well able to make the rising generation, as a whole, as good as, and a little better than, itself. If society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences. Armed not only with all the powers of education, but with the ascendancy which the authority of a received opinion always exercises over the minds who are least fitted to judge for themselves; and aided by the
natural penalties which cannot be prevented from falling on those who incur the distaste or the contempt of those who know them; let not society pretend that it needs, besides all this, the power to issue commands and enforce obedience in the personal concerns of individuals, in which, on all principles of justice and policy, the decision ought to rest with those who are to abide the consequences. Nor is there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the better means of influencing conduct, than a resort to the worse. If there be among those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence or temperance, any of the material of which vigorous and independent characters are made, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke. No such person will ever feel that others have a right to control him in his concerns, such as they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; and it easily comes to be considered a mark of spirit and courage to fly in the face of such usurped authority, and do with ostentation the exact opposite of what it enjoins; as in the fashion of grossness which succeeded, in the time of Charles II, to the fanatical moral intolerance of the Puritans. With respect to what is said of the necessity of protecting society from the bad example set to others by the vicious or the self-indulgent; it is true that bad example may have a pernicious effect, especially the example of doing wrong to others with impunity to the wrong-doer. But we are now speaking of conduct which, while it does no wrong to others, is supposed to do great harm to the agent himself: and I do not see how those who believe this, can think otherwise than that the example, on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful, since, if it displays the misconduct, it displays also the painful or degrading consequences which, if the conduct is justly censured, must be supposed to be in all or most cases attendant on it.",,"Society had every citizen's childhood to shape their character. If it failed, the answer is better education, not adult coercion. Compulsion in private life backfires: strong characters rebel on principle, doing the opposite as a badge of independence. And if self-destruction truly leads to ruin, the example includes the ruin -- a visible cautionary tale more powerful than any prohibition.","Indirect harm to society from private conduct is a cost freedom must bear. Society already had its chance through education; resorting to coercion in private life admits failure. Moreover, coercion provokes defiant rebellion, and if self-destructive behavior truly leads to ruin, the visible consequences serve as their own deterrent.",A society that fails to educate its citizens and then resorts to controlling their private lives is compounding its own failure.,4,30,,,,,"Charles II and the Restoration (1660) -- Mill references how the moral licentiousness of the Restoration era was a direct backlash against Puritan repression under Cromwell's Commonwealth (1649-1660). This pattern of moral backlash recurs throughout history: the Roaring Twenties following Prohibition, the 1960s counterculture following 1950s conformity. Mill's argument about education versus coercion anticipates modern 'nudge theory' (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008) -- the idea that shaping choice architecture is more effective than prohibition."
4.31,,,,"But the strongest argument against public interference in private conduct is simpler: the public almost always gets it wrong.

On questions of how people should treat each other, majority opinion has a decent track record -- people can judge what affects them directly. But on questions of how other people should live their private lives, majority opinion is essentially random. At best, it reflects some people's preferences about how others should behave. At worst -- and this is the common case -- the majority simply cannot tolerate anyone living differently from themselves. They experience another person's different lifestyle as a personal attack, the same way a religious zealot feels persecuted by someone else's different worship.

But there is no equivalence between the feeling of a person living their own life and the feeling of someone offended that they are living it. A person's taste, like their opinion or their property, is their own concern.

In theory, you can imagine an enlightened public that only interferes with conduct universally proven harmful. In practice, no such public has ever existed. Real publics do not consult universal experience. They consult their own feelings and call them morality. And they are egged on by philosophers and moralists who teach that right and wrong are simply what we feel them to be -- at which point the public does exactly what you would expect: it makes its own preferences mandatory for everyone.","But the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of the public with purely personal conduct, is that when it does interfere, the odds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place. On questions of social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of the public, that is, of an overruling majority, though often wrong, is likely to be still oftener right; because on such questions they are only required to judge of their own interests; of the manner in which some mode of conduct, if allowed to be practised, would affect themselves. But the opinion of a similar majority, imposed as a law on the minority, on questions of self-regarding conduct, is quite as likely to be wrong as right; for in these cases public opinion means, at the best, some people’s opinion of what is good or bad for other people; while very often it does not even mean that; the public, with the most perfect indifference, passing over the pleasure or convenience of those whose conduct they censure, and considering only their own preference. There are many who consider as an injury to themselves any conduct which they have a distaste for, and resent it as an outrage to their feelings; as a religious bigot, when charged with disregarding the religious feelings of others, has been known to retort that they disregard his feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship or creed. But there is no parity between the feeling of a person for his own opinion, and the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; no more than between the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of the right owner to keep it. And a person’s taste is as much his own peculiar concern as his opinion or his purse. It is easy for any one to imagine an ideal public, which leaves the freedom and choice of individuals in all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them to abstain from modes of conduct which universal experience has condemned. But where has there been seen a public which set any such limit to its censorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universal experience? In its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom thinking of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently from itself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held up to mankind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine-tenths of all moralists and speculative writers. These teach that things are right because they are right; because we feel them to be so. They tell us to search in our own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding on ourselves and on all others. What can the poor public do but apply these instructions, and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if they are tolerably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world?",,"On matters affecting others, the majority's judgment is passable. On matters of private life, it is essentially a coin flip dressed up as moral authority. Real publics do not consult universal experience -- they consult their own feelings and call them morality. And there is no equivalence between living your own life and being offended that someone else is living theirs.","The strongest argument against public interference in private life is that the public gets it wrong. On social morality, majority opinion is reasonable. On private conduct, it merely reflects the majority's discomfort with difference. The public confuses its own preferences with moral truth, encouraged by moralists who teach that feelings are the foundation of right and wrong.","The public's judgment on private conduct is just its own discomfort with difference, dressed in the language of morality.",4,31,,,,,"Mill's argument about moral intuitionism -- the philosophical position that moral truths are known by feeling -- targets thinkers like William Whewell, whose moral philosophy Mill criticized extensively. The analogy between the religious bigot who claims persecution and the thief who wants a purse is one of Mill's most striking rhetorical moves, equating moral offense with mere acquisitiveness. This passage anticipates the modern concept of 'offense creep' -- the tendency for the range of things considered offensive to expand over time."
4.32,,,,"This is not a theoretical problem. The tendency to impose private moral preferences through public power is one of the most universal human impulses, and it is at work right now. I need to show this with concrete examples -- not to catalogue every moral overreach in modern life, which would be a book in itself, but to demonstrate that the principle I am defending addresses real and present dangers.","The evil here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and it may perhaps be expected that I should specify the instances in which the public of this age and country improperly invests its own preferences with the character of moral laws. I am not writing an essay on the aberrations of existing moral feeling. That is too weighty a subject to be discussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration. Yet examples are necessary, to show that the principle I maintain is of serious and practical moment, and that I am not endeavouring to erect a barrier against imaginary evils. And it is not difficult to show, by abundant instances, that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police, until it encroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of the individual, is one of the most universal of all human propensities.",,"The impulse to police private life through public power is not theoretical. It is one of the most universal of human tendencies, and it is at work right now.","Mill transitions from theory to examples, arguing that moral overreach into private life is not hypothetical but one of the most common human tendencies, actively operating in his own time and needing concrete illustration.",The impulse to extend moral policing into private life is not a theoretical risk but one of the most universal human tendencies.,4,32,,,,,"Mill signals a shift from philosophical argument to practical illustration. The examples that follow (4.33-4.40) form a crescendo from distant cases to domestic controversies, a rhetorical strategy designed to make the reader feel the principle's immediate relevance."
4.33,,,,"Start with dietary laws. In many Muslim-majority countries, the majority finds pork consumption genuinely disgusting -- not merely forbidden but viscerally revolting, the way most Westerners react to eating insects or dogs. If the majority in such a country banned pork entirely, would that be a legitimate exercise of public moral authority?

Note that you cannot call this religious persecution -- no religion requires its followers to eat pork. The majority sincerely believes the practice is abhorrent. They sincerely believe God forbids it. The ban would rest on genuine and deeply held moral conviction.

But it would still be wrong. The only defensible reason to reject such a ban is the principle that what individuals eat is none of the public's business. Personal tastes and self-regarding choices are beyond the jurisdiction of majority opinion -- no matter how sincere, how widely shared, or how deeply felt that opinion may be.","As a first instance, consider the antipathies which men cherish on no better grounds than that persons whose religious opinions are different from theirs, do not practise their religious observances, especially their religious abstinences. To cite a rather trivial example, nothing in the creed or practice of Christians does more to envenom the hatred of Mahomedans against them, than the fact of their eating pork. There are few acts which Christians and Europeans regard with more unaffected disgust, than Mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfying hunger. It is, in the first place, an offence against their religion; but this circumstance by no means explains either the degree or the kind of their repugnance; for wine also is forbidden by their religion, and to partake of it is by all Mussulmans accounted wrong, but not disgusting. Their aversion to the flesh of the “unclean beast” is, on the contrary, of that peculiar character, resembling an instinctive antipathy, which the idea of uncleanness, when once it thoroughly sinks into the feelings, seems always to excite even in those whose personal habits are anything but scrupulously cleanly, and of which the sentiment of religious impurity, so intense in the Hindoos, is a remarkable example. Suppose now that in a people, of whom the majority were Mussulmans, that majority should insist upon not permitting pork to be eaten within the limits of the country. This would be nothing new in Mahomedan countries.
*9 Would it be a legitimate exercise of the moral authority of public opinion? and if not, why not? The practice is really revolting to such a public. They also sincerely think that it is forbidden and abhorred by the Deity. Neither could the prohibition be censured as religious persecution. It might be religious in its origin, but it would not be persecution for religion, since nobody’s religion makes it a duty to eat pork. The only tenable ground of condemnation would be, that with the personal tastes and self-regarding concerns of individuals the public has no business to interfere.",,"A Muslim majority could ban pork with sincere conviction and genuine disgust. No religion requires eating pork, so it would not even qualify as religious persecution. Yet it would still be tyranny -- because what a person eats is simply none of the public's business, no matter how sincere the majority's revulsion.","Mill uses the example of a Muslim majority banning pork to test his principle. The ban would rest on sincere moral conviction and genuine disgust, and could not be called religious persecution. Yet it would still be illegitimate, because personal dietary choices fall outside the public's jurisdiction.",The sincerity and depth of majority feeling does not create jurisdiction over individual choices that affect no one else.,4,33,,,,,"Mill's pork example was chosen because it reverses the usual Western perspective -- forcing his British audience to imagine being the minority whose personal habits are banned by a sincere majority. Islamic dietary law (halal/haram) forbids pork based on Quranic injunctions (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:173). Mill notes that wine is also forbidden in Islam but does not provoke the same visceral disgust, distinguishing rational prohibition from instinctive revulsion. The Hindu concept of ritual impurity (related to caste and food) is referenced as a parallel."
4.F9,,,,"The Bombay Parsees illustrate how imposed restrictions become internalized identity. When these Zoroastrian refugees fled Persia and arrived in western India, Hindu rulers granted them sanctuary on condition they not eat beef. When Muslim conquerors later took control, the Parsees secured continued tolerance by also abstaining from pork. Neither restriction had anything to do with their own religion. But over centuries, both became tribal custom -- and in much of the world, custom carries the force of religion.","9.
The case of the Bombay Parsees is a curious instance in point. When this industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the Persian fire-worshippers, flying from their native country before the Caliphs, arrived in Western India, they were admitted to toleration by the Hindoo sovereigns, on condition of not eating beef. When those regions afterwards fell under the dominion of Mahomedan conquerors, the Parsees obtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition of refraining from pork. What was at first obedience to authority became a second nature, and the Parsees to this day abstain both from beef and pork. Though not required by their religion, the double abstinence has had time to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom, in the East, is a religion.",,"The Parsees abstained from beef to appease Hindu rulers, then from pork to satisfy Muslim ones. Neither restriction was their own. But centuries later, both had become indistinguishable from sacred tradition -- proof that imposed custom and genuine belief eventually merge.","The Parsees (Zoroastrian refugees in India) adopted dietary restrictions -- no beef under Hindu rulers, no pork under Muslim rulers -- as conditions of tolerance. Over time, these politically imposed constraints became tribal custom indistinguishable from religious practice.","Restrictions imposed by power, maintained long enough, become indistinguishable from freely chosen tradition.",4,F9,Footnote,,,,"Bombay Parsees (Parsis) -- Zoroastrian refugees who fled the Arab conquest of Persia (7th-8th century CE) and settled in Gujarat, western India. The Caliphs -- the Islamic rulers whose conquest of Sassanid Persia drove the Zoroastrian exodus.

Mill uses their double dietary restriction as evidence that custom, regardless of origin, acquires the psychological force of religious commandment."
4.34,,,,"Bring it closer to home. In many countries today, the majority considers certain forms of worship blasphemous or immoral and bans them outright. In others, cultural norms treat certain family structures as inherently indecent -- not just wrong but disgusting. These are not insincere feelings. The people who hold them are genuinely appalled.

But if we accept the principle that majorities may impose their moral feelings on minorities in matters that do not harm others, we have no grounds to object when it is our practices being suppressed. Unless we are willing to adopt the logic of every persecutor in history -- 'we may impose our views because we are right, but they may not impose theirs because they are wrong' -- we must refuse the principle entirely. Any principle you would resent having applied to yourself, you cannot in good conscience apply to others.","To come somewhat nearer home: the majority of Spaniards consider it a gross impiety, offensive in the highest degree to the Supreme Being, to worship him in any other manner than the Roman Catholic; and no other public worship is lawful on Spanish soil. The people of all Southern Europe look upon a married clergy as not only irreligious, but unchaste, indecent, gross, disgusting. What do Protestants think of these perfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them against non-Catholics? Yet, if mankind are justified in interfering with each other’s liberty in things which do not concern the interests of others, on what principle is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? or who can blame people for desiring to suppress what they regard as a scandal in the sight of God and man? No stronger case can be shown for prohibiting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, than is made out for suppressing these practices in the eyes of those who regard them as impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logic of persecutors, and to say that we may persecute others because we are right, and that they must not persecute us because they are wrong, we must beware of admitting a principle of which we should resent as a gross injustice the application to ourselves.",,"Unless you are willing to adopt the persecutor's logic -- we may impose because we are right, they may not because they are wrong -- you must refuse the principle entirely. Any rule you would resent having applied to yourself, you cannot in good conscience apply to others.","If we accept that sincere moral majorities may suppress minority practices in personal life, we cannot object when our own practices are the ones being suppressed.

Laws against married clergy existed in the Catholic Church (mandatory celibacy formalized at the Second Lateran Council, 1139). Mill's 'logic of persecutors' argument is a universalizability test similar to Kant's categorical imperative -- asking whether you could consistently will the principle to be applied to yourself."
4.35,,,,"You might dismiss those examples as foreign problems that could never happen here. So consider one that is anything but distant: the impulse to ban entertainment and recreation on moral grounds.

Whenever religious conservatives have held sufficient power -- in colonial New England, in Cromwell's England, in communities today -- they have tried to shut down public amusements: music, dancing, theater, sports, social gatherings. This impulse is not extinct. There are large constituencies in every democracy who believe most popular entertainment is sinful, and they periodically gain enough political power to act on that belief.

How would the rest of the population react if their entertainment options were dictated by the strictest religious faction? They would say, rightly: mind your own business. And that is precisely what should be said to any government or public that claims the authority to decide which pleasures are permissible. Once you concede that principle, you have no defense when the faction imposing its tastes happens to be one you disagree with.","The preceding instances may be objected to, although unreasonably, as drawn from contingencies impossible among us: opinion, in this country, not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to interfere with people for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marrying, according to their creed or inclination. The next example, however, shall be taken from an interference with liberty which we have by no means passed all danger of. Wherever the Puritans have been sufficiently powerful, as in New England, and in Great Britain at the time of the Commonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable success, to put down all public, and nearly all private, amusements: especially music, dancing, public games, or other assemblages for purposes of diversion, and the theatre. There are still in this country large bodies of persons by whose notions of morality and religion these recreations are condemned; and those persons belonging chiefly to the middle class, who are the ascendant power in the present social and political condition of the kingdom, it is by no means impossible that persons of these sentiments may at some time or other command a majority in Parliament. How will the remaining portion of the community like to have the amusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religious and moral sentiments of the stricter Calvinists and Methodists? Would they not, with considerable peremptoriness, desire these intrusively pious members of society to mind their own business? This is precisely what should be said to every government and every public, who have the pretension that no person shall enjoy any pleasure which they think wrong. But if the principle of the pretension be admitted, no one can reasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, or other preponderating power in the country; and all persons must be ready to conform to the idea of a Christian commonwealth, as understood by the early settlers in New England, if a religious profession similar to theirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religions supposed to be declining have so often been known to do.",,"Whenever religious conservatives gain enough power, they ban entertainment. The rest of the population tells them, rightly: mind your own business. But if you concede the principle that majorities may dictate which pleasures are permissible, you have no defense when the faction in charge is one you oppose.","Mill points to the recurring impulse of religious conservatives to ban public amusements when they gain power. The proper response is 'mind your own business' -- but this response is only coherent if you reject the principle that majorities may legislate personal pleasures.

Calvinists and Methodists -- the two religious traditions Mill identifies as the strongest advocates of moral regulation of amusements in Victorian England. The broader pattern -- religiously motivated entertainment bans -- continues in various forms: content censorship debates, age-rating systems, and periodic moral panics over new media."
4.36,,,,"Consider another scenario, even more plausible. In democracies, there is a natural tendency for the majority to resent visible displays of wealth. In some parts of the United States, even now, conspicuous spending faces intense social disapproval -- an informal sumptuary law enforced by public opinion rather than statute.

This is not hypothetical. The feeling that no one should live noticeably better than average is a predictable product of democratic culture combined with the belief that the public has a say in how individuals spend their money. Push this further -- add a strong current of socialist sentiment -- and it becomes socially unacceptable to accumulate any significant wealth, or to earn more than what manual labor pays.

Versions of this already exist. In many workplaces, high performers face informal pressure from peers not to outperform -- to accept the same pay for superior work, to suppress skill or initiative that makes others look bad. This is enforced through social shaming and sometimes outright intimidation. If we accept that the public has jurisdiction over private economic choices, these people are doing nothing wrong. They are simply exercising the same authority over individual conduct that any moral majority claims.","To imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realized than the one last mentioned. There is confessedly a strong tendency in the modern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accompanied or not by popular political institutions. It is affirmed that in the country where this tendency is most completely realized—where both society and the government are most democratic—the United States—the feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy or costly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable, operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that in many parts of the Union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very large income, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur popular disapprobation. Though such statements as these are doubtless much exaggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of things they describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable result of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that the public has a right to a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spend their incomes. We have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion of Socialist opinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of the majority to possess more property than some very small amount, or any income not earned by manual labour. Opinions similar in principle to these, already prevail widely among the artizan class, and weigh oppressively on those who are amenable to the opinion chiefly of that class, namely, its own members. It is known that the bad workmen who form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, are decidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as good, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework or otherwise, to earn by superior skill or industry more than others can without it. And they employ a moral police, which occasionally becomes a physical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers from giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service. If the public have any jurisdiction over private concerns, I cannot see that these people are in fault, or that any individual’s particular public can be blamed for asserting the same authority over his individual conduct, which the general public asserts over people in general.",,"Democratic culture naturally resents visible inequality. Add the belief that the public may dictate private spending, and informal sumptuary laws emerge: social punishment for earning too much, performing too well, living too conspicuously. If the public has jurisdiction over private choices, the mob enforcing mediocrity is just exercising its authority.","Mill warns that democratic cultures naturally tend to resent visible wealth and superior achievement.

Mill observes that democracy can produce their informal equivalent. Tocqueville made a similar observation in Democracy in America (1835-1840) about the 'tyranny of the majority' and the pressure toward conformity in American life. The 'bad workmen' passage describes what economists later called 'rate-busting' -- informal worker sanctions against high performers -- a phenomenon extensively documented in the Hawthorne Studies (1924-1932). Mill's 'artizan class' refers to skilled manual workers, the core of the emerging British labor movement."
4.37,,,,"But we need not deal in hypotheticals. Real invasions of private liberty are happening now. And they are justified by a principle even more dangerous than any specific law: the claim that the public has an unlimited right not only to ban what it considers wrong, but to ban anything innocent in order to prevent what it considers wrong.","But, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our own day, gross usurpations upon the liberty of private life actually practised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation of success, and opinions propounded which assert an unlimited right in the public not only to prohibit by law everything which it thinks wrong, but in order to get at what it thinks wrong, to prohibit any number of things which it admits to be innocent.",,The most dangerous principle is not any specific ban but the claim that the public may prohibit innocent acts in order to prevent ones it dislikes.,"Mill moves from hypothetical scenarios to real contemporary encroachments on liberty, warning that the most dangerous claim is not any specific prohibition but the assertion that the public may ban innocent activities in order to suppress disapproved ones.",The most dangerous principle in politics is the claim that innocent activities may be banned to prevent disapproved ones.,4,37,,,,,"This passage serves as a transition from Mill's hypothetical examples to his concrete contemporary cases (prohibition, Sabbatarian laws, Mormon persecution).

4.38,,,,"Take prohibition. In Mill's time, it was alcohol. The pattern is the same today with every substance, activity, or technology that a determined minority decides the public cannot be trusted with.

The argument always escalates the same way. A temperance advocate in Mill's era argued that his 'social rights' were violated by the existence of alcohol -- because alcohol causes disorder that threatens his security, creates social costs he is taxed to support, and surrounds him with dangers that impede his moral development. By this logic, every individual has an absolute social right to have every other individual behave perfectly according to the complainer's own standards. Anyone who falls short in the smallest way violates this 'right' and justifies a demand for legislative action.

This is not a theory of social rights. It is a theory of total control. It recognizes no freedom at all except perhaps the freedom to hold opinions secretly, since the moment any disfavored opinion is spoken aloud, it 'invades' someone's social rights. It gives every person a vested interest in every other person's moral, intellectual, and physical perfection -- defined, naturally, by the claimant's own standards.","Under the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one English colony, and of nearly half the United States, have been interdicted by law from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except for medical purposes: for prohibition of their sale is in fact, as it is intended to be, prohibition of their use. And though the impracticability of executing the law has caused its repeal in several of the States which had adopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, an attempt has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted with considerable zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitate for a similar law in this country. The association, or “Alliance” as it terms itself, which has been formed for this purpose, has acquired some notoriety through the publicity given to a correspondence between its Secretary and one of the very few English public men who hold that a politician’s opinions ought to be founded on principles. Lord Stanley’s share in this correspondence is calculated to strengthen the hopes already built on him, by those who know how rare such qualities as are manifested in some of his public appearances, unhappily are among those who figure in political life. The organ of the Alliance, who would “deeply deplore the recognition of any principle which could be wrested to justify bigotry and persecution,” undertakes to point out the “broad and impassable barrier” which divides such principles from those of the association. “All matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience, appear to me,” he says, “to be without the sphere of legislation; all pertaining to social act, habit, relation, subject only to a discretionary power vested in the State itself, and not in the individual, to be within it.” No mention is made of a third class, different from either of these, viz. acts and habits which are not social, but individual; although it is to this class, surely, that the act of drinking fermented liquors belongs. Selling fermented liquors, however, is trading, and trading is a social act. But the infringement complained of is not on the liberty of the seller, but on that of the buyer and consumer; since the State might just as well forbid him to drink wine, as purposely make it impossible for him to obtain it. The Secretary, however, says, “I claim, as a citizen, a right to legislate whenever my social rights are invaded by the social act of another.” And now for the definition of these “social rights.” “If anything invades my social rights, certainly the traffic in strong drink does. It destroys my primary right of security, by constantly creating and stimulating social disorder. It invades my right of equality, by deriving a profit from the creation of a misery I am taxed to support. It impedes my right to free moral and intellectual development, by surrounding my path with dangers, and by weakening and demoralizing society, from which I have a right to claim mutual aid and intercourse.” A theory of “social rights,” the like of which probably never before found its way into distinct language: being nothing short of this—that it is the absolute social right of every individual, that every other individual shall act in every respect exactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in the smallest particular, violates my social right, and entitles me to demand from the legislature the removal of the grievance. So monstrous a principle is far more dangerous than any single interference with liberty; there is no violation of liberty which it would not justify; it acknowledges no right to any freedom whatever, except perhaps to that of holding opinions in secret, without ever disclosing them: for, the moment an opinion which I consider noxious passes any one’s lips, it invades all the “social rights” attributed to me by the Alliance. The doctrine ascribes to all mankind a vested interest in each other’s moral, intellectual, and even physical perfection, to be defined by each claimant according to his own standard.",,The prohibitionist's logic always escalates: my right to security is violated by your disorder; my right to equality is violated by the costs your behavior imposes; my right to moral development is impeded by your existence. Follow this logic to its conclusion and every imperfection in every other person becomes a violation of your rights. This is not social rights. It is a blueprint for total control.,"Mill dissects the prohibitionist argument that 'social rights' are violated by others' private behavior. Taken to its logical conclusion, this doctrine gives every person an absolute right to have every other person behave perfectly by the claimant's own standards -- a principle that would justify any interference with liberty whatsoever.",The claim that others' imperfect behavior violates your 'social rights' is not a theory of rights but a blueprint for total control.,4,38,,,,,"Maine Laws -- the first statewide prohibition law, passed in Maine in 1851 under Neal Dow's leadership, later repealed in 1856.

The quoted correspondence between the Alliance secretary and Lord Stanley was a real public exchange.

4.39,,,,"Consider laws mandating a day of rest. The principle behind them is reasonable enough: workers need protection from being forced to work seven days a week. If everyone else works Sundays, the pressure to do the same becomes coercive. So there is a legitimate case for guaranteeing a common day off, based on workers' direct interests.

But this justification extends only to protecting workers from compulsory labor. It does not extend to dictating what people do with their free time. It does not justify banning entertainment, closing museums, shutting down public transit, or forbidding recreation on that day. The only basis for such restrictions is the belief that certain activities are religiously wrong -- and that is a motive for legislation that should be resisted absolutely.

It is not society's job to avenge offenses against God. The idea that one person has a duty to ensure another person's religious compliance was the foundation of every religious persecution in history. The impulse behind shutting down Sunday trains and closing museums may lack the old cruelty, but the mentality is identical: an inability to tolerate others doing what your religion forbids, grounded in the belief that God holds you accountable for failing to stop them.","Another important example of illegitimate interference with the rightful liberty of the individual, not simply threatened, but long since carried into triumphant effect, is Sabbatarian legislation. Without doubt, abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of life permit, from the usual daily occupation, though in no respect religiously binding on any except Jews, is a highly beneficial custom. And inasmuch as this custom cannot be observed without a general consent to that effect among the industrious classes, therefore, in so far as some persons by working may impose the same necessity on others, it may be allowable and right that the law should guarantee to each the observance by others of the custom, by suspending the greater operations of industry on a particular day. But this justification, grounded on the direct interest which others have in each individual’s observance of the practice, does not apply to the self-chosen occupations in which a person may think fit to employ his leisure; nor does it hold good, in the smallest degree, for legal restrictions on amusements. It is true that the amusement of some is the day’s work of others; but the pleasure, not to say the useful recreation, of many, is worth the labour of a few, provided the occupation is freely chosen, and can be freely resigned. The operatives are perfectly right in thinking that if all worked on Sunday, seven days’ work would have to be given for six days’ wages: but so long as the great mass of employments are suspended, the small number who for the enjoyment of others must still work, obtain a proportional increase of earnings; and they are not obliged to follow those occupations, if they prefer leisure to emolument. If a further remedy is sought, it might be found in the establishment by custom of a holiday on some other day of the week for those particular classes of persons. The only ground, therefore, on which restrictions on Sunday amusements can be defended, must be that they are religiously wrong; a motive of legislation which never can be too earnestly protested against. “Deorum injuriæ Diis curæ.” It remains to be proved that society or any of its officers holds a commission from on high to avenge any supposed offence to Omnipotence, which is not also a wrong to our fellow creatures. The notion that it is one man’s duty that another should be religious, was the foundation of all the religious persecutions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify them. Though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to stop railway travelling on Sunday, in the resistance to the opening of Museums, and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, the state of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same. It is a determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their religion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor’s religion. It is a belief that God not only abominates the act of the misbeliever, but will not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested.",,Protecting workers from compulsory seven-day labor is legitimate.

Resistance to Sunday railway travel was a real Victorian controversy; the Lord's Day Observance Society campaigned against it. Museum opening hours on Sundays were contested throughout the 19th century; the National Gallery did not open on Sundays until 1896. Mill's argument distinguishes legitimate labor protection (preventing coerced seven-day work weeks) from illegitimate morals legislation (imposing religious observance through law)."
4.40,,,,"Finally, consider how societies treat religious minorities who practice what the majority finds abhorrent.

Mill wrote about the Mormons -- a new religion whose followers were murdered, expelled from their homes, and driven into the desert, where outsiders still debated whether to send military force to compel them to conform. The specific provocation was polygamy, which Mill himself condemned as a violation of liberty -- it shackled one half of the community while liberating the other from mutual obligation.

But here is the test: the Mormons had retreated to unsettled territory. They had built a community from nothing. They were not imposing their practices on anyone. Members were free to leave. Other countries were not asked to recognize their marriages. On what principle, besides raw tyranny, could outsiders justify forcing them to change?

The answer is: none. If you object to their practices, send missionaries. Make your case through persuasion. Compete in the marketplace of ideas. But you do not get to use force against a self-governing community that harms no outsiders, simply because their way of life offends you from a thousand miles away.

The same principle applies to any isolated community whose practices the mainstream finds repugnant. One contemporary writer proposed not a 'crusade' but a 'civilizade' -- a campaign to civilize them by force. But no community has the right to force another to be civilized. If your civilization cannot outcompete what you consider barbarism through the power of its own example, persuasion, and appeal -- if it needs force to survive -- then it deserves to fall. A civilization so fragile that it requires coercion to defend itself against a handful of dissenters in the desert has already rotted from within.","I cannot refrain from adding to these examples of the little account commonly made of human liberty, the language of downright persecution which breaks out from the press of this country, whenever it feels called on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of Mormonism. Much might be said on the unexpected and instructive fact, that an alleged new revelation, and a religion founded on it, the product of palpable imposture, not even supported by the
prestige of extraordinary qualities in its founder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and has been made the foundation of a society, in the age of newspapers, railways, and the electric telegraph. What here concerns us is, that this religion, like other and better religions, has its martyrs; that its prophet and founder was, for his teaching, put to death by a mob; that others of its adherents lost their lives by the same lawless violence; that they were forcibly expelled, in a body, from the country in which they first grew up; while, now that they have been chased into a solitary recess in the midst of a desert, many in this country openly declare that it would be right (only that it is not convenient) to send an expedition against them, and compel them by force to conform to the opinions of other people. The article of the Mormonite doctrine which is the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy; which, though permitted to Mahomedans, and Hindoos, and Chinese, seems to excite unquenchable animosity when practised by persons who speak English, and profess to be a kind of Christians. No one has a deeper disapprobation than I have of this Mormon institution; both for other reasons, and because, far from being in any way countenanced by the principle of liberty, it is a direct infraction of that principle, being a mere riveting of the chains of one-half of the community, and an emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them. Still, it must be remembered that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a wife at all. Other countries are not asked to recognise such unions, or release any portion of their inhabitants from their own laws on the score of Mormonite opinions. But when the dissentients have conceded to the hostile sentiments of others, far more than could justly be demanded; when they have left the countries to which their doctrines were unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of the earth, which they have been the first to render habitable to human beings; it is difficult to see on what principles but those of tyranny they can be prevented from living there under what laws they please, provided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfect freedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways. A recent writer, in some respects of considerable merit, proposes (to use his own words) not a crusade, but a
civilizade, against this polygamous community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde step in civilization. It also appears so to me, but I am not aware that any community has a right to force another to be civilized. So long as the sufferers by the bad law do not invoke assistance from other communities, I cannot admit that persons entirely unconnected with them ought to step in and require that a condition of things with which all who are directly interested appear to be satisfied, should be put an end to because it is a scandal to persons some thousands of miles distant, who have no part or concern in it. Let them send missionaries, if they please, to preach against it; and let them, by any fair means (of which silencing the teachers is not one,) oppose the progress of similar doctrines among their own people. If civilization has got the better of barbarism when barbarism had the world to itself, it is too much to profess to be afraid lest barbarism, after having been fairly got under, should revive and conquer civilization. A civilization that can thus succumb to its vanquished enemy, must first have become so degenerate, that neither its appointed priests and teachers, nor anybody else, has the capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it. If this be so, the sooner such a civilization receives notice to quit, the better. It can only go on from bad to worse, until destroyed and regenerated (like the Western Empire) by energetic barbarians.",,"The Mormons were murdered, expelled, and driven into the desert -- and still the outside world debated sending armies to force them to conform. On what principle? Not justice. Not self-defense. Only the conviction that distant strangers may be compelled to live as you see fit. If your civilization cannot outcompete what you call barbarism through persuasion and example alone, it deserves to fall. What needs force to survive has already rotted from within.","Mill uses the persecution of the Mormons as a final test case. Despite retreating to uninhabited territory and harming no outsiders, they still faced threats of military force. Mill condemns this: no community has the right to compel another to conform, no matter how offensive their practices. A civilization that requires force to defend itself against peaceful dissenters has already failed.",A civilization that cannot survive without forcing distant dissenters to conform has already failed on its own terms.,4,40,,,,,"Joseph Smith (1805-1844) -- founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois.

5.1,,,,The principles I have laid out will not reshape policy until they are widely accepted as starting points for debate. What follows is not a comprehensive program but a set of test cases -- illustrations designed to sharpen the two core principles and show where the line between them blurs.,"THE PRINCIPLES asserted in these pages must be more generally admitted as the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent application of them to all the various departments of government and morals can be attempted with any prospect of advantage. The few observations I propose to make on questions of detail, are designed to illustrate the principles, rather than to follow them out to their consequences. I offer, not so much applications, as specimens of application; which may serve to bring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the two maxims which together form the entire doctrine of this Essay, and to assist the judgment in holding the balance between them, in the cases where it appears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case.",,"Principles earn their keep at the border, where cases are hard and the right answer is not obvious. What follows are the hard cases.","Mill introduces this chapter as a set of practical illustrations, not a complete policy program. The goal is to test and clarify his two principles by applying them to real cases where the boundary is uncertain.",A principle untested by hard cases is a principle you do not yet understand.,5,1,,,,,"Mill's ""two maxims"" refer to the self-regarding/other-regarding distinction developed throughout the essay -- the idea that society may only interfere with conduct that harms others, not conduct affecting only the individual."
5.2,,,,"The two principles are simple. First: society has no authority over your purely self-regarding conduct. Others may advise you, argue with you, even shun you -- but not coerce you. Second: when your actions harm others, society may respond with social pressure or legal punishment, whichever protection requires.","The maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct. Secondly, that for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishment, if society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection.",,"Two rules. What concerns only you is yours alone -- others may persuade but never compel. What injures others is society's business, and society may act.","Mill restates his two core maxims: individuals are sovereign over self-regarding conduct, but accountable to society for actions that harm others. Society may use persuasion for the first, and punishment for the second.",Your life is yours to run; others' lives are where your freedom meets its boundary.,5,2,,,,,"These two maxims are the central thesis of the entire essay, first articulated in Chapter 1 (1.9) and developed through Chapters 2-4. The distinction between ""self-regarding"" and ""other-regarding"" conduct has been one of the most debated aspects of Mill's philosophy."
5.3,,,,"The fact that harm to others justifies interference does not mean every harm justifies it. Much of ordinary life involves imposing costs on others legitimately. Getting the job means someone else did not. Winning the contract means a competitor lost. Outperforming a rival in any fair contest produces losers.

Society accepts these harms because open competition serves everyone better than its absence. The only forms of competitive harm that warrant intervention are fraud and force. Beating someone fairly is not the kind of injury that triggers society's right to interfere -- even when the loser suffers genuinely.","In the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because damage, or probability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the interference of society, that therefore it always does justify such interference. In many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimate object, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss to others, or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope of obtaining. Such oppositions of interest between individuals often arise from bad social institutions, but are unavoidable while those institutions last; and some would be unavoidable under any institutions. Whoever succeeds in an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive examination; whoever is preferred to another in any contest for an object which both desire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, from their wasted exertion and their disappointment. But it is, by common admission, better for the general interest of mankind, that persons should pursue their objects undeterred by this sort of consequences. In other words, society admits no right, either legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this kind of suffering; and feels called on to interfere, only when means of success have been employed which it is contrary to the general interest to permit—namely, fraud or treachery, and force.",,"Not all harm is wrongful harm. Every job won is a job someone else lost. Society intervenes not when you outcompete someone, but when you cheat them. The line is not pain -- it is fraud and force.","Just because harm to others can justify intervention does not mean it always does. Competitive losses -- losing a job, a contract, a market -- are legitimate harms that society accepts because open competition benefits everyone. Only fraud and force cross the line.","Harm is a necessary condition for interference, not a sufficient one -- competition injures fairly, and fair injury is no grounds for coercion.",5,3,,,,,"Mill draws on classical liberal economic theory (Adam Smith, David Ricardo) that competition, while painful for losers, maximizes aggregate welfare. This passage anticipates modern antitrust reasoning: the law targets anticompetitive behavior (fraud, coercion, collusion), not the competitive process itself."
5.4,,,,"Trade is inherently social -- selling goods affects other people -- so it falls within society's jurisdiction in principle. For centuries, governments set prices and controlled manufacturing. We eventually learned that free markets deliver better goods at lower prices than central planning, and the case for free trade rests on this practical outcome, not on individual liberty as such.

This distinction matters. Regulations against food adulteration, workplace safety standards, consumer fraud protections -- these are legitimate exercises of social authority over commerce, limited only by whether they actually achieve their stated aims. The liberty principle is barely involved; the question is simply whether the regulation works.

But some trade restrictions are different in kind. When the government bans or restricts access to a product itself -- as with drug prohibition, restrictions on importing goods, or bans on specific substances -- the interference targets the buyer's freedom to choose. That is a liberty question, not merely an economic efficiency question, and it demands a different standard of justification.","Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture. But it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint,
quâ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely because they do not really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. As the principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free Trade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits of that doctrine; as for example, what amount of public control is admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary precautions, or arrangements to protect workpeople employed in dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questions involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to themselves is always better,
cæteris paribus, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty; such as the Maine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation of opium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. These interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer.",,"Free trade wins not because markets are sacred but because they deliver. Regulate fraud, safety, quality -- those are practical questions. But when government restricts what you may buy, it is no longer regulating commerce. It is controlling your choices.","Mill distinguishes two types of trade regulation. Rules governing how goods are sold (safety, fraud prevention, workplace standards) are legitimate social controls over commerce. But restrictions on whether a product can be obtained at all are restrictions on the buyer's liberty, and require justification under a different, higher standard.",Regulating how goods are sold is commerce policy; restricting whether you can buy them at all is a question of liberty.,5,4,,,,,"[Free Trade doctrine] -- Mill references the classical economic case for free trade developed by Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations, 1776) and David Ricardo. Mill himself was a major economic theorist (Principles of Political Economy, 1848).

5.5,,,,"The regulation of dangerous products -- drugs, weapons, chemicals with lethal potential -- raises the question of preventive authority. Government clearly has a role in preventing crime before it happens, not merely punishing it afterward. But preventive power is far more dangerous to liberty than punitive power, because virtually any freedom can be reframed as creating an opportunity for wrongdoing.

The key distinction is certainty of harm. If you see someone about to walk onto a bridge you know will collapse, you can physically stop them without violating their liberty -- they do not want to fall into the river. But when there is only a risk of harm, and the person is a competent adult, you may warn them but not compel them. They are the only legitimate judge of whether the risk is worth taking.

Applied to product regulation, this yields a practical framework. Labeling requirements -- warning that a substance is dangerous, that a product carries health risks -- are fully consistent with liberty. The buyer cannot reasonably wish to be uninformed. But requiring a prescription or license for every purchase would make legitimate use impossible or prohibitively expensive.

The better approach is creating a paper trail. Require sellers to record the transaction: date, buyer identity, quantity, stated purpose. For purchases without a prescription, require a witness. These measures create virtually no barrier to legitimate use but make criminal misuse far harder to conceal. The principle is not to prevent the purchase but to ensure that if something goes wrong, there is evidence.","One of these examples, that of the sale of poisons, opens a new question; the proper limits of what may be called the functions of police; how far liberty may legitimately be invaded for the prevention of crime, or of accident. It is one of the undisputed functions of government to take precautions against crime before it has been committed, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards. The preventive function of government, however, is far more liable to be abused, to the prejudice of liberty, than the punitory function; for there is hardly any part of the legitimate freedom of action of a human being which would not admit of being represented, and fairly too, as increasing the facilities for some form or other of delinquency. Nevertheless, if a public authority, or even a private person, sees any one evidently preparing to commit a crime, they are not bound to look on inactive until the crime is committed, but may interfere to prevent it. If poisons were never bought or used for any purpose except the commission of murder, it would be right to prohibit their manufacture and sale. They may, however, be wanted not only for innocent but for useful purposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed in the one case without operating in the other. Again, it is a proper office of public authority to guard against accidents. If either a public officer or any one else saw a person attempting to cross a bridge which had been ascertained to be unsafe, and there were no time to warn him of his danger, they might seize him and turn him back, without any real infringement of his liberty; for liberty consists in doing what one desires, and he does not desire to fall into the river. Nevertheless, when there is not a certainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the person himself can judge of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompt him to incur the risk: in this case, therefore, (unless he is a child, or delirious, or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full use of the reflecting faculty) he ought, I conceive, to be only warned of the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it. Similar considerations, applied to such a question as the sale of poisons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes of regulation are or are not contrary to principle. Such a precaution, for example, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of its dangerous character, may be enforced without violation of liberty: the buyer cannot wish not to know that the thing he possesses has poisonous qualities. But to require in all cases the certificate of a medical practitioner, would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, to obtain the article for legitimate uses. The only mode apparent to me, in which difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed through this means, without any infringement, worth taking into account, upon the liberty of those who desire the poisonous substance for other purposes, consists in providing what, in the apt language of Bentham, is called “preappointed evidence.” This provision is familiar to every one in the case of contracts. It is usual and right that the law, when a contract is entered into, should require as the condition of its enforcing performance, that certain formalities should be observed, such as signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, in order that in case of subsequent dispute, there may be evidence to prove that the contract was really entered into, and that there was nothing in the circumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being, to throw great obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made in circumstances which, if known, would destroy their validity. Precautions of a similar nature might be enforced in the sale of articles adapted to be instruments of crime. The seller, for example, might be required to enter in a register the exact time of the transaction, the name and address of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask the purpose for which it was wanted, and record the answer he received. When there was no medical prescription, the presence of some third person might be required, to bring home the fact to the purchaser, in case there should afterwards be reason to believe that the article had been applied to criminal purposes. Such regulations would in general be no material impediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerable one to making an improper use of it without detection.",,"Preventive power is more dangerous than punitive power -- almost any freedom can be recast as an opportunity for crime. The solution is not to ban what might be misused, but to ensure a trail of evidence. Make access easy and concealment hard.","Government may prevent crime, but preventive power threatens liberty more than punishment does. For dangerous products, the best approach preserves access while creating accountability: require labeling, record transactions, and ensure a paper trail -- making legitimate use easy and criminal misuse hard to hide.",Do not block access to what might be misused -- make misuse traceable.,5,5,,,,,"[Preappointed evidence] -- A term from Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), Mill's intellectual godfather and founder of utilitarianism. Bentham's concept refers to requiring documentation at the time of a transaction so that evidence exists if disputes or crimes arise later. Mill applies it to poison sales but the principle maps directly to modern regulatory frameworks: gun purchase background checks, pseudoephedrine purchase logs (Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, 2005), and controlled substance prescription monitoring programs."
5.6,,,,"Society's right to prevent harm to others also justifies targeted restrictions on individuals who have demonstrated they are dangerous. Substance use, in itself, is no business of the law. But if someone has been convicted of violence while intoxicated, placing them under a personal prohibition -- making it a separate offense for that specific person to be intoxicated again, and increasing penalties if they reoffend while impaired -- is entirely legitimate. Their intoxication is no longer self-regarding; it is a demonstrated precursor to harming others.

The same logic applies to neglect. You cannot criminalize unemployment or idleness as such -- that would be tyranny. But if someone fails to meet their legal obligations to dependents, the state can compel compliance. A parent who will not support their children can be forced to work to meet that obligation. The coercion targets the breach of duty, not the lifestyle.","The right inherent in society, to ward off crimes against itself by antecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the maxim, that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled with in the way of prevention or punishment. Drunkenness, for example, in ordinary cases, is not a fit subject for legislative interference; but I should deem it perfectly legitimate that a person, who had once been convicted of any act of violence to others under the influence of drink, should be placed under a special legal restriction, personal to himself; that if he were afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to a penalty, and that if when in that state he committed another offence, the punishment to which he would be liable for that other offence should be increased in severity. The making himself drunk, in a person whom drunkenness excites to do harm to others, is a crime against others. So, again, idleness, except in a person receiving support from the public, or except when it constitutes a breach of contract, cannot without tyranny be made a subject of legal punishment; but if, either from idleness or from any other avoidable cause, a man fails to perform his legal duties to others, as for instance to support his children, it is no tyranny to force him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory labor, if no other means are available.",,"Your drinking is your business -- until you have proven it becomes someone else's emergency. Then your intoxication is no longer private conduct; it is a demonstrated threat, and the law may treat it as one.","Mill argues that self-regarding behavior like drinking can become legitimately subject to legal restriction when a specific individual has demonstrated a pattern of harming others while engaged in it. Similarly, idleness cannot be criminalized, but failure to meet legal obligations to dependents can be compelled.",A personal history of causing harm under specific conditions transforms private conduct into a public concern for that individual alone.,5,6,,,,,"Mill's proposal for individualized drinking restrictions based on prior violent conduct anticipates modern legal tools: DUI probation with sobriety conditions, SCRAM alcohol-monitoring bracelets, and court-ordered substance abuse treatment. The principle of targeting restrictions at demonstrated risk rather than blanket prohibition remains central to debates about criminal justice reform and risk-based sentencing."
5.7,,,,"Some acts harm only the person doing them and therefore cannot be prohibited -- but performing them in public is a different matter. Public indecency, for instance, offends others not because the underlying act is wrong but because forcing it on unwilling observers is itself a form of imposition. The objection is to the publicity, not the conduct, and this applies equally to acts that are not inherently objectionable.","Again, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, if done publicly, are a violation of good manners, and coming thus within the category of offences against others, may rightfully be prohibited. Of this kind are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary to dwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our subject, the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case of many actions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so.",,What you do in private is yours. What you force others to witness becomes theirs.

The principle that the offense lies in unwanted exposure rather than in the act itself anticipates the ""captive audience"" doctrine in First Amendment jurisprudence."
5.8,,,,"If people must be free to engage in self-regarding conduct, should others be equally free to encourage or profit from that conduct? This is genuinely difficult.

Advising someone to do something is a social act -- it affects another person. But if we protect the right to act, we must protect the right to discuss, advise, and recommend action. Whatever is permitted to do must be permitted to advocate doing. Freedom of action without freedom of counsel is incoherent.

The question gets harder when the advisor profits from the advice -- when someone makes a living from facilitating what society considers harmful. Should you be free to use drugs but not to deal them? Free to gamble but not to run a casino? The tension is real. On one side: if the activity is legal, the business of facilitating it should be legal too. You cannot consistently permit the act while criminalizing the infrastructure. On the other: society may reasonably want to limit the influence of parties who profit from promoting harmful behavior and whose financial interest makes them inherently biased counselors.

Mill finds force in both arguments and does not fully resolve the tension. He notes that most goods can be used in excess, and sellers always profit from encouraging consumption -- but this alone cannot justify prohibition, because the sellers are also necessary for legitimate use. The compromise: where sellers have a financial interest in promoting harmful overconsumption, the state may impose regulations and requirements that would otherwise violate liberty -- licensing, operating restrictions, accountability measures -- precisely because that commercial interest warrants oversight.","There is another question to which an answer must be found, consistent with the principles which have been laid down. In cases of personal conduct supposed to be blameable, but which respect for liberty precludes society from preventing or punishing, because the evil directly resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do, ought other persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? This question is not free from difficulty. The case of a person who solicits another to do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct. To give advice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and may, therefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed amenable to social control. But a little reflection corrects the first impression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within the definition of individual liberty, yet the reasons on which the principle of individual liberty is grounded, are applicable to it. If people must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act as seems best to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be free to consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchange opinions, and give and receive suggestions. Whatever it is permitted to do, it must be permitted to advise to do. The question is doubtful, only when the instigator derives a personal benefit from his advice; when he makes it his occupation, for subsistence or pecuniary gain, to promote what society and the State consider to be an evil. Then, indeed, a new element of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classes of persons with an interest opposed to what is considered as the public weal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it. Ought this to be interfered with, or not? Fornication, for example, must be tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a person be free to be a pimp, or to keep a gambling-house? The case is one of those which lie on the exact boundary line between two principles, and it is not at once apparent to which of the two it properly belongs. There are arguments on both sides. On the side of toleration it may be said, that the fact of following anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by the practice of it, cannot make that criminal which would otherwise be admissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted or consistently prohibited; that if the principles which we have hitherto defended are true, society has no business,
as society, to decide anything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannot go beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuade, as another to dissuade. In opposition to this it may be contended, that although the public, or the State, are not warranted in authoritatively deciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or such conduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad, they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that its being so or not is at least a disputable question: That, this being supposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the influence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators who cannot possibly be impartial—who have a direct personal interest on one side, and that side the one which the State believes to be wrong, and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only. There can surely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by so ordering matters that persons shall make their election, either wisely or foolishly, on their own prompting, as free as possible from the arts of persons who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes of their own. Thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawful games are utterly indefensible—though all persons should be free to gamble in their own or each other’s houses, or in any place of meeting established by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members and their visitors—yet public gambling-houses should not be permitted. It is true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that, whatever amount of tyrannical power may be given to the police, gambling-houses can always be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled to conduct their operations with a certain degree of secrecy and mystery, so that nobody knows anything about them but those who seek them; and more than this, society ought not to aim at. There is considerable force in these arguments. I will not venture to decide whether they are sufficient to justify the moral anomaly of punishing the accessary, when the principal is (and must be) allowed to go free; of fining or imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-house keeper, but not the gambler. Still less ought the common operations of buying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds. Almost every article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and the sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but no argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the Maine Law; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, though interested in their abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimate use. The interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperance is a real evil, and justifies the State in imposing restrictions and requiring guarantees which, but for that justification, would be infringements of legitimate liberty.",,"Whatever is legal to do must be legal to advise. But when someone profits from promoting what harms you, their counsel is compromised -- and society may regulate the profiteer even while tolerating the practice.","If an act is permitted, advising someone to do it must also be permitted -- freedom of action requires freedom of counsel. But when someone profits from facilitating harmful behavior (dealers, casino operators), society faces a genuine tension. Mill allows regulation of commercial facilitators whose financial interest in overconsumption creates a conflict of interest, even when the underlying activity remains legal.","You may do it, and I may advise you to -- but when I profit from your excess, my counsel is suspect and my business is fair game for regulation.",5,8,,,,,"[Maine Law] (1851) -- Referenced again as the archetypal prohibitionist statute. [Fornication and gambling] -- Mill's examples of self-regarding conduct that society may tolerate while debating whether to permit commercial facilitation (pimping, gambling houses). This maps directly to modern debates about legal marijuana and the regulation of dispensaries, legal sports betting and casino regulation, legal sex work and the regulation of brothels (as in Nevada or the Netherlands), and the distinction between decriminalization and legalization."
5.9,,,,"Should the state use taxation to discourage harmful personal choices -- sin taxes on alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks?

Taxing something solely to price people out of it is just prohibition by degree. Every price increase is a total prohibition for those who cannot afford the markup, and a penalty on those who can. How people spend their money after meeting their obligations is their own affair.

But taxation is unavoidable, much of it necessarily falls on consumer goods, and every consumption tax creates some deterrent effect. Given that the state must tax something, it should prefer to tax goods that consumers can most easily do without -- and among those, goods whose heavy use is actively harmful. Taxing alcohol, tobacco, and similar products up to the revenue-maximizing rate is not an infringement on liberty. It is sensible fiscal policy that happens to align with public health.","A further question is, whether the State, while it permits, should nevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary to the best interests of the agent; whether, for example, it should take measures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to the difficulty of procuring them by limiting the number of the places of sale. On this as on most other practical questions, many distinctions require to be made. To tax stimulants for the sole purpose of making them more difficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only in degree from their entire prohibition; and would be justifiable only if that were justifiable. Every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those whose means do not come up to the augmented price; and to those who do, it is a penalty laid on them for gratifying a particular taste. Their choice of pleasures, and their mode of expending their income, after satisfying their legal and moral obligations to the State and to individuals, are their own concern, and must rest with their own judgment. These considerations may seem at first sight to condemn the selection of stimulants as special subjects of taxation for purposes of revenue. But it must be remembered that taxation for fiscal purposes is absolutely inevitable; that in most countries it is necessary that a considerable part of that taxation should be indirect; that the State, therefore, cannot help imposing penalties, which to some persons may be prohibitory, on the use of some articles of consumption. It is hence the duty of the State to consider, in the imposition of taxes, what commodities the consumers can best spare; and
à fortiori, to select in preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate quantity, to be positively injurious. Taxation, therefore, of stimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount of revenue (supposing that the State needs all the revenue which it yields) is not only admissible, but to be approved of.",,"A tax designed to prohibit is just prohibition with a price tag. But since the state must tax something, let it tax what people can spare -- and what harms them in excess.","Taxing a product solely to deter its use is functionally equivalent to prohibition and violates liberty. But since taxation is inevitable, the state should prefer to tax goods that are dispensable and harmful in excess. Sin taxes up to the revenue-maximizing rate are legitimate fiscal policy, not liberty violations.","Sin taxes are justified as revenue policy, not as behavior control -- the moment deterrence becomes the goal, taxation becomes prohibition by another name.",5,9,,,,,"[a fortiori] -- Latin: ""with even stronger reason."" Mill's argument about sin taxes remains directly relevant to modern policy debates: tobacco taxes, alcohol excise duties, sugar taxes (UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy, 2018), carbon taxes, and proposed taxes on ultra-processed foods. The revenue-maximizing principle he invokes (the peak of the Laffer curve, though Mill predates that terminology) is the key constraint -- taxation for revenue is legitimate, taxation for behavioral control is not."
5.10,,,,"Licensing the sale of alcohol and similar products is a separate question from taxation. Bars and nightclubs are gathering places where disorder commonly originates, so requiring sellers to hold licenses, meet standards of responsible operation, maintain regulated hours, and lose their license after repeated violations is perfectly justified. This is ordinary policing.

But limiting the total number of licenses to make access more difficult is a different matter entirely. It punishes everyone for the anticipated misbehavior of a few. Worse, it reflects a paternalism that treats working people as incapable of self-governance -- placing them under a regime of managed access supposedly to prepare them for freedoms they already nominally possess.

No one who genuinely values freedom would accept this logic unless every effort at education and trust had been exhausted and definitively failed. The very suggestion that such efforts have been exhausted is absurd. The real problem is institutional inconsistency: we adopt paternalist controls borrowed from authoritarian systems while maintaining a general framework of liberty that prevents those controls from achieving their supposed educational purpose. The result is neither freedom nor effective paternalism -- just incoherence.","The question of making the sale of these commodities a more or less exclusive privilege, must be answered differently, according to the purposes to which the restriction is intended to be subservient. All places of public resort require the restraint of a police, and places of this kind peculiarly, because offences against society are especially apt to originate there. It is, therefore, fit to confine the power of selling these commodities (at least for consumption on the spot) to persons of known or vouched-for respectability of conduct; to make such regulations respecting hours of opening and closing as may be requisite for public surveillance, and to withdraw the license if breaches of the peace repeatedly take place through the connivance or incapacity of the keeper of the house, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting and preparing offences against the law. Any further restriction I do not conceive to be, in principle, justifiable. The limitation in number, for instance, of beer and spirit houses, for the express purpose of rendering them more difficult of access, and diminishing the occasions of temptation, not only exposes all to an inconvenience because there are some by whom the facility would be abused, but is suited only to a state of society in which the labouring classes are avowedly treated as children or savages, and placed under an education of restraint, to fit them for future admission to the privileges of freedom. This is not the principle on which the labouring classes are professedly governed in any free country; and no person who sets due value on freedom will give his adhesion to their being so governed, unless after all efforts have been exhausted to educate them for freedom and govern them as freemen, and it has been definitively proved that they can only be governed as children. The bare statement of the alternative shows the absurdity of supposing that such efforts have been made in any case which needs be considered here. It is only because the institutions of this country are a mass of inconsistencies, that things find admittance into our practice which belong to the system of despotic, or what is called paternal, government, while the general freedom of our institutions precludes the exercise of the amount of control necessary to render the restraint of any real efficacy as a moral education.",,"License sellers, regulate hours, revoke permits for disorder -- that is policing. But capping licenses to ration access treats adults as children being trained for a freedom they are told they already have.",Licensing sellers of alcohol for responsible operation is legitimate policing. But artificially limiting the number of licenses to restrict access is paternalism that treats citizens as incapable of self-governance. It reflects an incoherent mix of authoritarian control methods within a nominally free society.,"Regulate how products are sold, not how many places dare to sell them -- rationing access is paternalism dressed as public safety.",5,10,,,,,"Mill targets Britain's licensing system for public houses (pubs), which restricted the number of alcohol-selling establishments. This maps to modern liquor license caps in many U.S. cities, which artificially limit competition, inflate license values (a New York City liquor license can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars), and create barrier-to-entry problems. Mill's argument anticipates critiques of supply-side restriction as a public health strategy."
5.11,,,,"Liberty in personal matters implies the freedom to make binding agreements with others about those same matters. Contracts are essential, and generally they should be enforced. But not all contracts deserve enforcement.

The clearest case: you cannot sell yourself into slavery. The entire justification for respecting individual choice is that choice reflects what the chooser values. But a contract that permanently surrenders your capacity to choose destroys the very foundation on which we respected your choice in the first place. Freedom cannot logically require the right to permanently abolish your own freedom.

This principle extends beyond slavery, though less absolutely. Long-term personal commitments -- employment contracts that bind for years, marriages, any arrangement involving ongoing personal service -- raise the same tension in lesser degree. Mill, drawing on Humboldt, argues that personal-service contracts should never be binding indefinitely, and that marriage in particular should be dissolvable by either party's declared will.

But Mill adds a critical qualification that Humboldt omits. When your commitment has led others to depend on you -- when a partner has built their life around your promises, when children exist because of your relationship -- new obligations arise that cannot be dismissed. These obligations may not justify forcing you to remain in the contract forever, but they must weigh heavily on the moral calculus. The legal freedom to exit may be preserved, but the moral responsibility for what your exit costs others is real and binding.

This distinction between legal freedom and moral responsibility is essential. In debates about marriage and family, we typically consider only the interests of children and ignore the legitimate interests of the adults involved. Both matter.","It was pointed out in an early part of this Essay, that the liberty of the individual, in things wherein the individual is alone concerned, implies a corresponding liberty in any number of individuals to regulate by mutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard no persons but themselves. This question presents no difficulty, so long as the will of all the persons implicated remains unaltered; but since that will may change, it is often necessary, even in things in which they alone are concerned, that they should enter into engagements with one another; and when they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that those engagements should be kept. Yet, in the laws, probably, of every country, this general rule has some exceptions. Not only persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other civilized countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person’s voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty. His voluntary choice is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. But by selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he foregoes any future use of it beyond that single act. He therefore defeats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principle of freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is not freedom, to be allowed to alienate his freedom. These reasons, the force of which is so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of far wider application; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessities of life, which continually require, not indeed that we should resign our freedom, but that we should consent to this and the other limitation of it. The principle, however, which demands uncontrolled freedom of action in all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that those who have become bound to one another, in things which concern no third party, should be able to release one another from the engagement: and even without such voluntary release, there are perhaps no contracts or engagements, except those that relate to money or money’s worth, of which one can venture to say that there ought to be no liberty whatever of retractation. Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, in the excellent essay from which I have already quoted, states it as his conviction, that engagements which involve personal relations or services, should never be legally binding beyond a limited duration of time; and that the most important of these engagements, marriage, having the peculiarity that its objects are frustrated unless the feelings of both the parties are in harmony with it, should require nothing more than the declared will of either party to dissolve it. This subject is too important, and too complicated, to be discussed in a parenthesis, and I touch on it only so far as is necessary for purposes of illustration. If the conciseness and generality of Baron Humboldt’s dissertation had not obliged him in this instance to content himself with enunciating his conclusion without discussing the premises, he would doubtless have recognised that the question cannot be decided on grounds so simple as those to which he confines himself. When a person, either by express promise or by conduct, has encouraged another to rely upon his continuing to act in a certain way—to build expectations and calculations, and stake any part of his plan of life upon that supposition—a new series of moral obligations arises on his part towards that person, which may possibly be overruled, but cannot be ignored. And again, if the relation between two contracting parties has been followed by consequences to others; if it has placed third parties in any peculiar position, or, as in the case of marriage, has even called third parties into existence, obligations arise on the part of both the contracting parties towards those third persons, the fulfilment of which, or at all events the mode of fulfilment, must be greatly affected by the continuance or disruption of the relation between the original parties to the contract. It does not follow, nor can I admit, that these obligations extend to requiring the fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the happiness of the reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in the question; and even if, as Von Humboldt maintains, they ought to make no difference in the
legal freedom of the parties to release themselves from the engagement (and I also hold that they ought not to make
much difference), they necessarily make a great difference in the
moral freedom. A person is bound to take all these circumstances into account, before resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is morally responsible for the wrong. I have made these obvious remarks for the better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and not because they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on the contrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children was everything, and that of grown persons nothing.",,"You cannot sell yourself into slavery, because freedom that includes the right to permanently destroy itself is not freedom at all. But every long-term commitment involves a lesser version of the same surrender -- and the people who built their lives around your promises do not vanish when you change your mind.","Freedom implies the right to make binding agreements, but not agreements that permanently surrender freedom itself -- you cannot sell yourself into slavery. Long-term personal commitments should be dissolvable, but when others have built their lives around your promises, genuine moral obligations arise that the right to exit does not erase.",The principle of freedom cannot require the freedom to irrevocably destroy your own freedom -- but the right to exit a commitment does not erase the obligations your commitment created.,5,11,,,,,"[Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt] (1767-1835) -- Prussian philosopher, linguist, and statesman whose The Limits of State Action (written 1791-1792, published posthumously 1852) deeply influenced Mill. Humboldt argued for minimal state interference and that personal-service contracts, including marriage, should be terminable. Mill dedicates On Liberty partly in response to Humboldt's work. [Slavery contracts] -- Mill's argument that one cannot validly consent to slavery anticipates the modern legal doctrine of inalienable rights -- rights that cannot be waived even voluntarily. This principle appears in the 13th Amendment (1865), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), and modern contract law's refusal to enforce unconscionable agreements."
5.12,,,,"Liberty is often invoked to protect the wrong things while genuine freedoms go undefended. Nowhere is this more visible than in how we treat parental authority.

A person should be free in their own affairs -- but acting on behalf of another is not the same as acting for yourself. When you exercise power over someone else, society has not just the right but the obligation to oversee that power. This obligation is most neglected precisely where it matters most: within the family.

The case of spousal power has a straightforward solution: equal rights and equal legal protection. No one seriously argues that spousal domination is a matter of ""liberty"" -- defenders of that arrangement openly champion power, not freedom.

Children are the harder case. Parents invoke liberty to resist any state involvement in how they raise their children, as though a child were an extension of the parent rather than a separate person. People who would accept enormous restrictions on their own freedom fight furiously against the slightest oversight of their authority over their children. This reveals something uncomfortable: most people value power more than they value liberty.

Consider education. It should be self-evident that the state must require every child to be educated to a basic standard. Yet this principle meets fierce resistance. We unanimously agree that parents have a sacred duty to educate their children -- and then refuse to hold anyone accountable for failing to do it. We treat free schooling as an optional gift rather than an enforceable obligation.

Bringing a child into the world without the means or intention to educate them is a moral crime against the child and against society. When parents fail this duty, the state must step in and compel it -- at the parent's expense wherever possible.","I have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised general principles, liberty is often granted where it should be withheld, as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the cases in which, in the modern European world, the sentiment of liberty is the strongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether misplaced. A person should be free to do as he likes in his own concerns; but he ought not to be free to do as he likes in acting for another, under the pretext that the affairs of the other are his own affairs. The State, while it respects the liberty of each in what specially regards himself, is bound to maintain a vigilant control over his exercise of any power which it allows him to possess over others. This obligation is almost entirely disregarded in the case of the family relations, a case, in its direct influence on human happiness, more important than all others taken together. The almost despotic power of husbands over wives needs not be enlarged upon here, because nothing more is needed for the complete removal of the evil, than that wives should have the same rights, and should receive the protection of law in the same manner, as all other persons; and because, on this subject, the defenders of established injustice do not avail themselves of the plea of liberty, but stand forth openly as the champions of power. It is in the case of children, that misapplied notions of liberty are a real obstacle to the fulfilment by the State of its duties. One would almost think that a man’s children were supposed to be literally, and not metaphorically, a part of himself, so jealous is opinion of the smallest interference of law with his absolute and exclusive control over them; more jealous than of almost any interference with his own freedom of action: so much less do the generality of mankind value liberty than power. Consider, for example, the case of education. Is it not almost a self-evident axiom, that the State should require and compel the education, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is born its citizen? Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise and assert this truth? Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the most sacred duties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand, the father), after summoning a human being into the world, to give to that being an education fitting him to perform his part well in life towards others and towards himself. But while this is unanimously declared to be the father’s duty, scarcely anybody, in this country, will bear to hear of obliging him to perform it. Instead of his being required to make any exertion or sacrifice for securing education to the child, it is left to his choice to accept it or not when it is provided gratis! It still remains unrecognised, that to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for its mind, is a moral crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and against society; and that if the parent does not fulfil this obligation, the State ought to see it fulfilled, at the charge, as far as possible, of the parent.",,We invoke liberty to shield parental power from oversight while neglecting the liberty of children who never chose their circumstances. The tell is this: people who accept vast restrictions on their own freedom will fight to the death against the slightest constraint on their power over their children.,"Parental authority is often shielded by misapplied notions of liberty, when it is actually an exercise of power over others that society should oversee. Education should be compulsory -- parents who fail to educate their children commit a moral crime, and the state must enforce this duty.",People value power over their children far more than they value their own liberty -- and call both by the same name.,5,12,,,,,"Mill's argument for compulsory education preceded England's Elementary Education Act (Forster Act) of 1870, which established the framework for universal public education in England and Wales, and the 1880 Act that made attendance compulsory. His argument about spousal rights anticipates the Married Women's Property Acts (1870, 1882) which gave wives independent legal standing in England. The broader principle -- that parental rights are fiduciary rather than proprietary -- continues to drive debates about homeschooling regulation, educational neglect laws, children's rights, and the tension between parental autonomy and child welfare."
5.13,,,,"Once we accept that education must be compulsory, the fight over what the state should teach and how it should teach largely dissolves. The state does not need to provide education -- it needs to require it. Let parents choose the school, the method, the philosophy. The state's role is to fund families who cannot afford tuition and to verify, through examination, that every child is actually learning.

State-run education as the dominant system is something to resist, not embrace. Everything said in this essay about the importance of individuality and diversity applies with equal force to education. A government monopoly on schooling is a machine for producing conformity -- and the template it imposes will always reflect whoever holds power. Monarchy, theocracy, aristocracy, or simple majority rule -- the result is the same: a despotism over minds that naturally extends to a despotism over lives.

State schools should exist, if at all, as one competitor among many -- a benchmark that keeps other schools honest, not a monopoly that replaces them. In societies too undeveloped to sustain private education, the state may have to step in as the lesser evil. But wherever a country has enough qualified teachers to staff government schools, those same teachers could staff independent ones -- provided compulsory education laws guarantee them a market and public funding supports families who need it.","Were the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted, there would be an end to the difficulties about what the State should teach, and how it should teach, which now convert the subject into a mere battle-field for sects and parties, causing the time and labour which should have been spent in educating, to be wasted in quarrelling about education. If the government would make up its mind to
require for every child a good education, it might save itself the trouble of
providing one. It might leave to parents to obtain the education where and how they pleased, and content itself with helping to pay the school fees of the poorer classes of children, and defraying the entire school expenses of those who have no one else to pay for them. The objections which are urged with reason against State education, do not apply to the enforcement of education by the State, but to the State’s taking upon itself to direct that education: which is a totally different thing. That the whole or any large part of the education of the people should be in State hands, I go as far as any one in deprecating. All that has been said of the importance of individuality of character, and diversity in opinions and modes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable importance, diversity of education. A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation, in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body. An education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exist at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence. Unless, indeed, when society in general is in so backward a state that it could not or would not provide for itself any proper institutions of education, unless the government undertook the task: then, indeed, the government may, as the less of two great evils, take upon itself the business of schools and universities, as it may that of joint stock companies, when private enterprise, in a shape fitted for undertaking great works of industry, does not exist in the country. But in general, if the country contains a sufficient number of persons qualified to provide education under government auspices, the same persons would be able and willing to give an equally good education on the voluntary principle, under the assurance of remuneration afforded by a law rendering education compulsory, combined with State aid to those unable to defray the expense.",,The state must require education.

5.14,,,,"Enforcement should work through universal public examinations, starting early. Test every child at a set age for basic literacy. If the child fails, fine the parent -- and place the child in school at the parent's expense. Annual testing with expanding scope ensures not just acquisition but retention of fundamental knowledge. Beyond the mandatory minimum, offer voluntary examinations in any subject, with certificates for those who pass.

The critical safeguard against state indoctrination: examinations in contested subjects -- religion, politics, ethics -- must test knowledge of positions, not agreement with them. The question should never be whether an opinion is true, but whether the student understands what the opinion is, what grounds support it, and who holds it. A philosophy student benefits from being examined on both Locke and Kant regardless of which they favor. An atheist can be fairly tested on the evidence for Christianity without being required to profess belief.

Mandatory examinations should cover only objective knowledge and practical skills. Higher-level certification should be entirely voluntary. Giving government the power to exclude people from professions based on alleged qualification failures is too dangerous. Following Humboldt, certificates should be available to anyone who passes the test -- but should confer no legal advantage, only whatever credibility public opinion attaches to them.","The instrument for enforcing the law could be no other than public examinations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age. An age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to ascertain if he (or she) is able to read. If a child proves unable, the father, unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be subjected to a moderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his labour, and the child might be put to school at his expense. Once in every year the examination should be renewed, with a gradually extending range of subjects, so as to make the universal acquisition, and what is more, retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge, virtually compulsory. Beyond that minimum, there should be voluntary examinations on all subjects, at which all who come up to a certain standard of proficiency might claim a certificate. To prevent the State from exercising, through these arrangements, an improper influence over opinion, the knowledge required for passing an examination (beyond the merely instrumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use) should, even in the higher classes of examinations, be confined to facts and positive science exclusively. The examinations on religion, politics, or other disputed topics, should not turn on the truth or falsehood of opinions, but on the matter of fact that such and such an opinion is held, on such grounds, by such authors, or schools, or churches. Under this system, the rising generation would be no worse off in regard to all disputed truths, than they are at present; they would be brought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the State merely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, or instructed dissenters. There would be nothing to hinder them from being taught religion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where they were taught other things. All attempts by the State to bias the conclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects, are evil; but it may very properly offer to ascertain and certify that a person possesses the knowledge, requisite to make his conclusions, on any given subject, worth attending to. A student of philosophy would be the better for being able to stand an examination both in Locke and in Kant, whichever of the two he takes up with, or even if with neither: and there is no reasonable objection to examining an atheist in the evidences of Christianity, provided he is not required to profess a belief in them. The examinations, however, in the higher branches of knowledge should, I conceive, be entirely voluntary. It would be giving too dangerous a power to governments, were they allowed to exclude any one from professions, even from the profession of teacher, for alleged deficiency of qualifications: and I think, with Wilhelm von Humboldt, that degrees, or other public certificates of scientific or professional acquirements, should be given to all who present themselves for examination, and stand the test; but that such certificates should confer no advantage over competitors, other than the weight which may be attached to their testimony by public opinion.",,"Test what children know, not what they believe.

In an overpopulated society or one approaching overpopulation, producing children beyond what you can support harms everyone who works for a living by driving down wages through labor competition. Some continental European countries historically required proof of financial means before granting a marriage license. Whatever you think of such laws practically, they are not violations of liberty -- they are restrictions on an act that demonstrably harms others.

The inconsistency is revealing. Society readily restricts personal freedoms that harm no one else while fiercely defending the right to impose genuine suffering on children and communities through irresponsible reproduction. We seem to believe that people have an inalienable right to harm others but no right to make purely personal choices that bother no one.","It is not in the matter of education only, that misplaced notions of liberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from being recognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there are the strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for the latter also. The fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being, is one of the most responsible actions in the range of human life. To undertake this responsibility—to bestow a life which may be either a curse or a blessing—unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will have at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crime against that being. And in a country either over-peopled or threatened with being so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, with the effect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is a serious offence against all who live by the remuneration of their labour. The laws which, in many countries on the Continent, forbid marriage unless the parties can show that they have the means of supporting a family, do not exceed the legitimate powers of the State: and whether such laws be expedient or not (a question mainly dependent on local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable as violations of liberty. Such laws are interferences of the State to prohibit a mischievous act—an act injurious to others, which ought to be a subject of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is not deemed expedient to superadd legal punishment. Yet the current ideas of liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom of the individual in things which concern only himself, would repel the attempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequence of their indulgence is a life or lives of wretchedness and depravity to the offspring, with manifold evils to those sufficiently within reach to be in any way affected by their actions. When we compare the strange respect of mankind for liberty, with their strange want of respect for it, we might imagine that a man had an indispensable right to do harm to others, and no right at all to please himself without giving pain to any one.",,We restrict what people do to themselves while defending their right to bring children into misery. As if harming others were sacred and pleasing yourself were criminal.,Bringing children into the world without means to support them is a harm to both the child and to society. Laws requiring financial capacity before parenthood are legitimate restrictions on other-harming conduct. Yet society inconsistently restricts harmless personal choices while defending the right to impose suffering through irresponsible reproduction.,Society will police your private pleasures while defending your right to bring children into deprivation -- a perfect inversion of where liberty actually demands protection.,5,15,,,,,"[Continental marriage laws] -- Several German and Austrian states in the 19th century required proof of financial means (Vermogensnachweis) before issuing marriage licenses. Bavaria maintained such laws until 1868. [Malthusian concerns] -- Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) argued in An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that population growth would outstrip food supply. Mill was deeply influenced by Malthusian economics and was arrested at age 17 for distributing birth control literature. His views on population control were controversial even in his time and remain so -- modern parallels include China's one-child policy (1979-2015) and ongoing debates about reproductive rights, welfare conditionality, and environmental arguments for smaller families."
5.16,,,,"A final class of questions concerns government intervention that does not restrict liberty at all -- cases where the issue is not whether to constrain people but whether to help them. Should the government do things for citizens that they could do for themselves, individually or through voluntary cooperation?","I have reserved for the last place a large class of questions respecting the limits of government interference, which, though closely connected with the subject of this Essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it. These are cases in which the reasons against interference do not turn upon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining the actions of individuals, but about helping them: it is asked whether the government should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit, instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually, or in voluntary combination.",,"The last question is not whether government may restrain you, but whether it should replace you -- doing for you what you could do for yourself.",Mill turns to a distinct category of government action: not restricting liberty but providing services. The question is whether the state should do things for people that they could accomplish themselves or through voluntary association.,"The deepest question about government is not what it may forbid, but what it should attempt to provide.",5,16,,,,,Mill shifts from negative liberty (freedom from interference) to questions about the proper scope of government services -- what political philosophers would later call the distinction between the minimal state and the welfare state. This transition anticipates the central debate of 20th-century politics.
5.17,,,,"Even when government help does not threaten liberty, there are three distinct reasons to be skeptical of it.","The objections to government interference, when it is not such as to involve infringement of liberty, may be of three kinds.",,Three reasons to resist government help even when it threatens no one's freedom.,"Mill identifies three separate objections to government intervention that go beyond liberty concerns, which he will elaborate in the following passages.",The case against government action does not end where the case for liberty ends -- three further objections remain.,5,17,,,,,"Mill structures his final argument as a tripartite case. This organizational move is characteristic of his systematic philosophical method, inherited from his father James Mill and from Bentham's analytical approach."
5.18,,,,"First, individuals usually do things better than government. The people with the strongest interest in an outcome are generally the best judges of how to achieve it. This is the standard economic argument against state management of industry, well established by political economists and not unique to the liberty principle.","The first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be better done by individuals than by the government. Speaking generally, there is no one so fit to conduct any business, or to determine how or by whom it shall be conducted, as those who are personally interested in it. This principle condemns the interferences, once so common, of the legislature, or the officers of government, with the ordinary processes of industry. But this part of the subject has been sufficiently enlarged upon by political economists, and is not particularly related to the principles of this Essay.",,No one manages your affairs better than you do -- because no one cares about them as much as you do.,The first objection to government action: individuals with a personal stake in outcomes generally perform better than government officials. This is the familiar efficiency argument from classical economics.,The person most invested in the result is usually the most competent to pursue it.,5,18,,,,,"Mill invokes the classical liberal economic argument developed by Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" concept and the broader tradition of political economy. This efficiency argument -- that decentralized decision-making by interested parties outperforms centralized management -- remains the foundational argument for market economies and against central planning."
5.19,,,,"Second, and more important for liberty: even when government could do something better, it is often preferable for citizens to do it themselves -- because the doing is itself educational.

Jury duty, local government, community organizations, voluntary associations, cooperative enterprises -- these are not just mechanisms for getting things done. They are training grounds for democratic citizenship. They pull people out of private self-interest and force them to grapple with collective problems, exercise judgment on public matters, and coordinate with others toward shared goals. Without this practical education in self-governance, free institutions cannot survive. Political freedom collapses in countries where it rests on no foundation of local practice and civic habit.

Citizen-led activity also preserves the diversity that government action destroys. Government operations are uniform by nature. Voluntary efforts are endlessly varied -- each one an experiment that generates new knowledge about what works.

The state's highest-value role is not to do the work itself but to collect, synthesize, and disseminate the lessons from all these distributed experiments. Be the clearinghouse for what others learn -- not the sole experimenter that tolerates no alternatives.","The second objection is more nearly allied to our subject. In many cases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so well, on the average, as the officers of government, it is nevertheless desirable that it should be done by them, rather than by the government, as a means to their own mental education—a mode of strengthening their active faculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar knowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal. This is a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial (in cases not political); of free and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conduct of industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary associations. These are not questions of liberty, and are connected with that subject only by remote tendencies; but they are questions of development. It belongs to a different occasion from the present to dwell on these things as parts of national education; as being, in truth, the peculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the political education of a free people, taking them out of the narrow circle of personal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to the comprehension of joint interests, the management of joint concerns—habituating them to act from public or semi-public motives, and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of isolating them from one another. Without these habits and powers, a free constitution can neither be worked nor preserved; as is exemplified by the too-often transitory nature of political freedom in countries where it does not rest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties. The management of purely local business by the localities, and of the great enterprises of industry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pecuniary means, is further recommended by all the advantages which have been set forth in this Essay as belonging to individuality of development, and diversity of modes of action. Government operations tend to be everywhere alike. With individuals and voluntary associations, on the contrary, there are varied experiments, and endless diversity of experience. What the State can usefully do, is to make itself a central depository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experience resulting from many trials. Its business is to enable each experimentalist to benefit by the experiments of others; instead of tolerating no experiments but its own.",,"The point of citizens doing things for themselves is not just the result but the education. Jury duty, town councils, voluntary associations -- these are the gymnasium of self-governance. A people who never practice ruling themselves will never be capable of it.","Even when government could do something more efficiently, citizen-led action is often preferable because it educates people in self-governance, builds civic capacity, and preserves diverse experimentation. The state's best role is collecting and sharing lessons from many experiments, not monopolizing activity.",Self-governance is a skill learned only through practice -- every task the state takes from citizens is a lesson in citizenship they never receive.,5,19,,,,,"[Jury trial] -- Mill cites jury service as civic education, a tradition rooted in English common law dating to the Magna Carta (1215). Alexis de Tocqueville made similar arguments in Democracy in America (1835-1840), which Mill reviewed favorably. [Local liberties] -- Mill's argument that national freedom requires a foundation of local self-governance echoes Tocqueville's analysis of American township democracy. [New England States] -- Referenced in 5.23, the New England town meeting model exemplified the local democratic practice Mill admired. The argument that voluntary association builds civic capacity anticipates Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone (2000) thesis about the decline of social capital."
5.20,,,,"Third, and most urgent: every additional function the government absorbs increases its power, its patronage, and its gravitational pull on ambitious people. If roads, railways, banks, insurance companies, universities, charities, and local governments all became departments of central administration -- if every career path led through the state -- no amount of press freedom or democratic elections would make the country meaningfully free.

The danger scales with competence. The more efficiently the bureaucratic machine operates, the more completely it dominates. When critics of competitive civil service examinations argued that government salaries could not attract top talent, they were accidentally describing the system's safety valve. If all the best minds were drawn into government, the result would be a concentration of ability so total that no external force could check it.

Imagine a society where every complex undertaking required the bureaucracy's involvement. The bureaucracy would contain all the country's practical intelligence. The public, having no experience managing anything, would lack the knowledge to evaluate what the bureaucracy does. Even a reformist leader could accomplish nothing the bureaucracy opposed -- because executing policy requires the bureaucracy's cooperation, and they can veto any directive simply by not implementing it.

This was the condition of Tsarist Russia: the Czar could exile any individual bureaucrat to Siberia but could not govern against the bureaucratic class. In countries with more democratic traditions, the pattern plays out differently but arrives at the same destination. Citizens who expect the state to handle everything hold the state responsible for everything -- and when conditions become intolerable, they revolt. But revolution merely replaces one set of rulers with another while the bureaucracy that actually runs the country continues unchanged. Nothing fundamental shifts because no one outside the bureaucracy is capable of governing.","The third, and most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government, is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power. Every function superadded to those already exercised by the government, causes its influence over hopes and fears to be more widely diffused, and converts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the public into hangers-on of the government, or of some party which aims at becoming the government. If the roads, the railways, the banks, the insurance offices, the great joint-stock companies, the universities, and the public charities, were all of them branches of the government; if, in addition, the municipal corporations and local boards, with all that now devolves on them, became departments of the central administration; if the employés of all these different enterprises were appointed and paid by the government, and looked to the government for every rise in life; not all the freedom of the press and popular constitution of the legislature would make this or any other country free otherwise than in name. And the evil would be greater, the more efficiently and scientifically the administrative machinery was constructed—the more skilful the arrangements for obtaining the best qualified hands and heads with which to work it. In England it has of late been proposed that all the members of the civil service of government should be selected by competitive examination, to obtain for those employments the most intelligent and instructed persons procurable; and much has been said and written for and against this proposal. One of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents, is that the occupation of a permanent official servant of the State does not hold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attract the highest talents, which will always be able to find a more inviting career in the professions, or in the service of companies and other public bodies. One would not have been surprised if this argument had been used by the friends of the proposition, as an answer to its principal difficulty. Coming from the opponents it is strange enough. What is urged as an objection is the safety-valve of the proposed system. If indeed all the high talent of the country
could be drawn into the service of the government, a proposal tending to bring about that result might well inspire uneasiness. If every part of the business of society which required organized concert, or large and comprehensive views, were in the hands of the government, and if government offices were universally filled by the ablest men, all the enlarged culture and practised intelligence in the country, except the purely speculative, would be concentrated in a numerous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest of the community would look for all things: the multitude for direction and dictation in all they had to do; the able and aspiring for personal advancement. To be admitted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and when admitted, to rise therein, would be the sole objects of ambition. Under this régime, not only is the outside public ill-qualified, for want of practical experience, to criticize or check the mode of operation of the bureaucracy, but even if the accidents of despotic or the natural working of popular institutions occasionally raise to the summit a ruler or rulers of reforming inclinations, no reform can be effected which is contrary to the interest of the bureaucracy. Such is the melancholy condition of the Russian empire, as shown in the accounts of those who have had sufficient opportunity of observation. The Czar himself is powerless against the bureaucratic body; he can send any one of them to Siberia, but he cannot govern without them, or against their will. On every decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining from carrying it into effect. In countries of more advanced civilization and of a more insurrectionary spirit, the public, accustomed to expect everything to be done for them by the State, or at least to do nothing for themselves without asking from the State not only leave to do it, but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the State responsible for all evil which befals them, and when the evil exceeds their amount of patience, they rise against the government and make what is called a revolution; whereupon somebody else, with or without legitimate authority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his orders to the bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before; the bureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable of taking their place.",,"Every function government absorbs makes it harder to resist. The final stage is a society where the bureaucracy holds all practical intelligence and the public, having managed nothing for themselves, lack the competence to check it. Even a revolution just changes the names on the doors -- the machine keeps running.","The most critical reason to limit government scope: every additional function increases state power and draws talented people into government service, creating a bureaucratic monopoly on competence. When citizens lose the capacity for self-governance, even revolutions cannot produce real change -- they merely swap rulers while the bureaucracy continues unchanged.","A government that absorbs every function eventually absorbs every capable person -- and a society that cannot govern itself cannot reform itself, even through revolution.",5,20,,,,,"[Competitive civil service examinations] -- The Northcote-Trevelyan Report (1854) proposed replacing patronage-based civil service appointments with competitive examinations in Britain, a reform Mill supported in principle but worried about in scope. [Russian Empire] -- Mill's description of the Czar as powerless against his own bureaucracy draws on contemporary accounts of the Russian administrative state under Nicholas I (r. 1825-1855) and Alexander II (r. 1855-1881). The observation that bureaucracies can veto reform through non-implementation remains a central insight of modern political science (see principal-agent theory and the concept of ""bureaucratic drift""). [Revolution cycle] -- Mill's description of revolution replacing rulers while bureaucracy persists fits the pattern of the French Revolution and its aftermath, which Mill knew intimately. It also anticipates analysis of the Russian Revolution (1917), the Arab Spring (2011), and other cases where regime change failed to alter administrative structures."
5.21,,,,"The antidote is a citizenry accustomed to managing its own affairs. Mill contrasts two models. In France, widespread military service meant that during every political upheaval, there were competent people available to organize and lead -- because they had practiced leadership in the army. In America, the habit of self-governance was so deeply ingrained that any group of citizens could improvise a functioning government from scratch.

This is what a free people looks like: not a people whose government is benevolent, but a people who could govern themselves if the government vanished tomorrow. Such a people can never be permanently enslaved, because no bureaucracy can force a self-governing population to accept what it rejects.

The inverse is equally true. Where everything runs through the bureaucracy, nothing the bureaucracy opposes can happen. And the more perfectly the bureaucratic machine selects and trains the most capable people, the more total the enslavement becomes -- for everyone, including the bureaucrats themselves. A senior official in a total bureaucracy is as much a prisoner of the system as the lowest citizen. A Chinese mandarin was as much a creature of despotism as the poorest peasant. A Jesuit was utterly subordinated to his order, even though the order existed to amplify the collective power of its members. The system consumes its own operators.","A very different spectacle is exhibited among a people accustomed to transact their own business. In France, a large part of the people having been engaged in military service, many of whom have held at least the rank of non-commissioned officers, there are in every popular insurrection several persons competent to take the lead, and improvise some tolerable plan of action. What the French are in military affairs, the Americans are in every kind of civil business; let them be left without a government, every body of Americans is able to improvise one, and to carry on that or any other public business with a sufficient amount of intelligence, order, and decision. This is what every free people ought to be: and a people capable of this is certain to be free; it will never let itself be enslaved by any man or body of men because these are able to seize and pull the reins of the central administration. No bureaucracy can hope to make such a people as this do or undergo anything that they do not like. But where everything is done through the bureaucracy, nothing to which the bureaucracy is really adverse can be done at all. The constitution of such countries is an organization of the experience and practical ability of the nation, into a disciplined body for the purpose of governing the rest; and the more perfect that organization is in itself, the more successful in drawing to itself and educating for itself the persons of greatest capacity from all ranks of the community, the more complete is the bondage of all, the members of the bureaucracy included. For the governors are as much the slaves of their organization and discipline, as the governed are of the governors. A Chinese mandarin is as much the tool and creature of a despotism as the humblest cultivator. An individual Jesuit is to the utmost degree of abasement the slave of his order, though the order itself exists for the collective power and importance of its members.",,"A free people is not one with a good government but one that could improvise a government by morning if the old one vanished tonight. Where bureaucracy manages everything, even the bureaucrats are its prisoners -- the mandarin no less enslaved than the peasant.","The remedy for bureaucratic dominance is a citizenry practiced in self-governance. Americans could improvise a government from nothing because self-management was habitual. Where bureaucracy monopolizes all competence, everyone becomes its prisoner -- including the bureaucrats, who are as enslaved to the system as those they govern.",The bureaucrats are as much prisoners of total bureaucracy as the citizens they administer -- the system enslaves its own operators.,5,21,,,,,"[France and military service] -- Mill references the widespread military experience of French citizens following the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815) and subsequent conflicts, which created a population with organizational and leadership skills. [Americans and self-governance] -- Mill echoes Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1835-1840) on American civic capacity. [Chinese mandarin] -- Mill uses Qing Dynasty China as his primary example of bureaucratic stagnation throughout On Liberty. The imperial examination system (keju), which selected officials through competitive testing, was the world's oldest meritocratic bureaucracy -- and in Mill's view, the clearest example of how meritocratic selection could produce total institutional sclerosis. [Jesuits] -- The Society of Jesus (founded 1540), known for extreme hierarchical discipline and obedience. Mill uses the Jesuits as an example of how individuals can be completely subordinated to an organization that nominally exists to serve their collective interests."
5.22,,,,"There is a further danger: when a bureaucracy absorbs all the country's talent, it eventually destroys its own capacity for innovation. A closed system, operating by fixed rules and selecting for internal conformity, oscillates between two failure modes: stagnant routine and impulsive, half-examined reforms championed by whichever leader temporarily captures internal attention.

The only force that keeps a bureaucracy intellectually alive is external criticism from people of equal ability who are not part of the system. If all capable people are inside the bureaucracy, no one outside has the standing or knowledge to challenge it. A healthy society must therefore ensure that talent, experience, and practical judgment develop independently of government -- so that the bureaucracy faces a permanent external check from people who actually know what they are talking about.

If we want competent public administration that can actually innovate and improve, we must not let government monopolize the activities that develop administrative competence. A bureaucracy without external challengers degenerates into what Mill calls a pedantocracy -- rule by the procedurally correct but intellectually dead.","It is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all the principal ability of the country into the governing body is fatal, sooner or later, to the mental activity and progressiveness of the body itself. Banded together as they are—working a system which, like all systems, necessarily proceeds in a great measure by fixed rules—the official body are under the constant temptation of sinking into indolent routine, or, if they now and then desert that mill-horse round, of rushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy of some leading member of the corps: and the sole check to these closely allied, though seemingly opposite, tendencies, the only stimulus which can keep the ability of the body itself up to a high standard, is liability to the watchful criticism of equal ability outside the body. It is indispensable, therefore, that the means should exist, independently of the government, of forming such ability, and furnishing it with the opportunities and experience necessary for a correct judgment of great practical affairs. If we would possess permanently a skilful and efficient body of functionaries—above all, a body able to originate and willing to adopt improvements; if we would not have our bureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, this body must not engross all the occupations which form and cultivate the faculties required for the government of mankind.",,"A bureaucracy that absorbs all the talent destroys its own capacity for renewal. Without external minds of equal caliber to challenge it, the system oscillates between dead routine and reckless impulse. The cure for bureaucratic decay is talent that the bureaucracy does not own.","When bureaucracy monopolizes talent, it loses the external criticism necessary for self-correction. Closed systems oscillate between stagnant routine and impulsive reform. A healthy society must cultivate competence outside government to serve as a permanent check on bureaucratic quality.","A bureaucracy without external critics of equal ability will inevitably degenerate -- either into mindless routine or reckless experimentation, with no one qualified to tell the difference.",5,22,,,,,"[Pedantocracy] -- Mill coins this term (from Greek pedant + kratos/rule) to describe governance by rigid proceduralists who have lost the capacity for substantive judgment. The concept maps to modern critiques of institutional sclerosis, regulatory capture, and what public administration scholars call ""goal displacement"" -- when following procedures replaces achieving outcomes. Mill's argument that healthy institutions require external challenge anticipates the modern concept of competitive pressure in organizational theory and the argument for independent regulators, inspectors general, and external auditors."
5.23,,,,"Finding the right boundary -- where centralized power begins to do more harm than good -- is one of the hardest problems in governance. No absolute rule covers every case. But there is a practical principle that can guide every decision: maximize the dispersal of power while maximizing the centralization of information.

In practice, this means local decisions should be made locally, by officers chosen by and accountable to local communities. But alongside this distributed authority, there should be a central body in each domain whose job is to collect, analyze, and share what every locality is learning. This central body observes what works and what fails across all jurisdictions and in other countries, synthesizes the evidence, and makes it available to everyone. Its advice would carry natural authority because of its comprehensive perspective -- but its actual power should be limited to ensuring that local officers follow the laws the legislature has established. Beyond that, local officers exercise their own judgment, answerable to their own constituents.

The principle is this: a government that informs, advises, and occasionally calls out failure is adding value. A government that replaces citizen effort with its own activity, that makes people work under its direction or pushes them aside to do their work for them, is destroying value.

The ultimate measure of a state is the quality of the people who compose it. A state that sacrifices the intellectual development and moral growth of its citizens for marginal gains in administrative efficiency -- that deliberately keeps people small so they will be easier to manage -- will eventually discover that small people cannot accomplish great things. The perfection of the machinery means nothing when you have banished the vital power that makes the machine worth building.

With small men, no great thing can really be accomplished.","To determine the point at which evils, so formidable to human freedom and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predominate over the benefits attending the collective application of the force of society, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacles which stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of the advantages of centralized power and intelligence, as can be had without turning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the general activity—is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in the art of government. It is, in a great measure, a question of detail, in which many and various considerations must be kept in view, and no absolute rule can be laid down. But I believe that the practical principle in which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the standard by which to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the difficulty, may be conveyed in these words: the greatest dissemination of power consistent with efficiency; but the greatest possible centralization of information, and diffusion of it from the centre. Thus, in municipal administration, there would be, as in the New England States, a very minute division among separate officers, chosen by the localities, of all business which is not better left to the persons directly interested; but besides this, there would be, in each department of local affairs, a central superintendence, forming a branch of the general government. The organ of this superintendence would concentrate, as in a focus, the variety of information and experience derived from the conduct of that branch of public business in all the localities, from everything analogous which is done in foreign countries, and from the general principles of political science. This central organ should have a right to know all that is done, and its special duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired in one place available for others. Emancipated from the petty prejudices and narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehensive sphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much authority; but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, I conceive, be limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laid down for their guidance. In all things not provided for by general rules, those officers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibility to their constituents. For the violation of rules, they should be responsible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by the legislature; the central administrative authority only watching over their execution, and if they were not properly carried into effect, appealing, according to the nature of the case, to the tribunals to enforce the law, or to the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries who had not executed it according to its spirit. Such, in its general conception, is the central superintendence which the Poor Law Board is intended to exercise over the administrators of the Poor Rate throughout the country. Whatever powers the Board exercises beyond this limit, were right and necessary in that peculiar case, for the cure of rooted habits of maladministration in matters deeply affecting not the localities merely, but the whole community; since no locality has a moral right to make itself by mismanagement a nest of pauperism, necessarily overflowing into other localities, and impairing the moral and physical condition of the whole labouring community. The powers of administrative coercion and subordinate legislation possessed by the Poor Law Board (but which, owing to the state of opinion on the subject, are very scantily exercised by them), though perfectly justifiable in a case of first-rate national interest, would be wholly out of place in the superintendence of interests purely local. But a central organ of information and instruction for all the localities, would be equally valuable in all departments of administration. A government cannot have too much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids and stimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief begins when, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individuals and bodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of informing, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them work in fetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead of them. The worth of a State, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a State which postpones the interests of
their mental expansion and elevation, to a little more of administrative skill, or that semblance of it which practice gives, in the details of business; a State which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes—will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished; and that the perfection of machinery to which it has sacrificed everything, will in the end avail it nothing, for want of the vital power which, in order that the machine might work more smoothly, it has preferred to banish.",,"Centralize information. Disperse power. Let the state inform, advise, and hold to account -- never replace. For the worth of a state is the worth of the individuals composing it, and a state that dwarfs its people to make them manageable will find that with small men, no great thing can be accomplished.","The governing principle for state action: maximize dispersal of power while centralizing information. Let local communities govern themselves while a central body collects and shares what works. The state should inform and advise, never replace citizen effort. A state that dwarfs its citizens for administrative convenience will find that diminished people cannot achieve greatness.","Centralize information, disperse power -- and never forget that a state which shrinks its citizens to make them governable will find that small people cannot accomplish great things.",5,23,,,,,"[New England States] -- Mill cites the New England town meeting as a model of distributed local governance with minute division of responsibilities among elected local officers. [Poor Law Board] -- Established by the Poor Law Amendment Act (1834), this central body oversaw local administration of poor relief across England and Wales. Mill considers it a practical example of his information-centralization principle, though he notes its coercive powers were justified only by the extreme dysfunction of local poor relief administration. [The final sentence] -- ""With small men no great thing can really be accomplished"" is one of Mill's most quoted lines and encapsulates his entire political philosophy: institutions exist to develop human capacity, not to substitute for it. This resonates with modern debates about civic engagement decline, technocratic governance, algorithmic management, and whether optimizing systems at the cost of human development is ultimately self-defeating."
