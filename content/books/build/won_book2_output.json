The vast majority of what they need comes from other people's labor, purchased with the products -- or the sale price of the products -- of their own work. However, this exchange cannot happen until their own product has been both completed and sold. Therefore, a reserve of goods must be stored up somewhere, sufficient to sustain the worker and supply them with the materials and tools of their trade, at least until both of these things -- completion and sale -- can be accomplished. A weaver, for example, cannot devote themselves entirely to weaving unless there is already a reserve stored somewhere, whether in their own possession or someone else's, large enough to support them and provide materials and tools until they have not only finished their cloth but also sold it. This accumulation must clearly come before the weaver can commit their labor to such specialized work for any extended period.",

A weaver cannot specialize unless such a stock is already accumulated. This accumulation must precede specialization.",

But however small that proportion may be, since only a portion -- often a small one -- of annual output is devoted to maintaining industry, money must always bear a substantial proportion to that maintenance fund. Therefore, when paper money reduces the needed gold and silver to perhaps a fifth of the former amount, if even the greater part of the other four-fifths is added to the fund supporting industry, it must create a very significant addition to the quantity of industry and consequently to the value of annual output.",

But in ancient times, under feudalism, only a tiny fraction of produce was needed to replace the capital used in cultivation. That capital typically consisted of a few miserable cattle fed entirely on the natural produce of uncultivated land, and could therefore be considered part of that natural produce. It usually belonged to the landlord and was advanced by him to those who worked the land. All the rest of the produce also belonged to the landlord, whether as rent for his land or as profit on this meager capital. The cultivators were generally serfs whose persons and possessions alike were his property. Those who were not serfs were tenants at will; though the rent they paid was often nominally little more than a token, it effectively amounted to the whole produce of the land. Their lord could command their labor in peace and their military service in war at any time. Though they lived far from his house, they were as dependent on him as the retainers who lived in it. The entire produce of the land undoubtedly belongs to whoever can dispose of the labor and service of all those it maintains. In modern Europe, the landlord's share seldom exceeds a third, sometimes not a quarter, of the total produce. Yet land rents in all improved areas have tripled or quadrupled since those ancient times; so this third or quarter of today's produce appears to be three or four times greater than the entire produce was then.

An enormous share of the country's annual output has, since the Revolution, been diverted to maintaining extraordinary numbers of unproductive workers. Had those wars not diverted so much capital in this direction, most of it would naturally have been used to maintain productive workers whose labor would have replaced, with a profit, the whole value of their consumption. The annual output would have been considerably increased each year, and each year's increase would have amplified the next.

    "summary": "Despite claims about agricultural profitability, no European fortunes have been made from farming comparable to those from trade and manufacturing. Yet abundant land remains underutilized. Smith promises that Books III and IV will explain why European policy has distorted capital away from agriculture toward distant trade.",
    "distilled": "European fortunes are made in trade and manufacturing, not agriculture, despite vast uncultivated land -- Books III and IV will explain the policy distortions responsible.",
    "notes": "Closes Book II by setting up the central puzzle of Books III and IV: if agriculture is the most socially productive use of capital, why does European policy make urban and distant trade more privately profitable? The empirical observation -- no agricultural fortunes comparable to trading ones -- is a powerful reality check against physiocratic idealism. The 'two following books' promise connects Book II's theoretical framework to Book III's historical narrative and Book IV's policy critique. This is one of the most important transitional passages in the entire Wealth of Nations."
