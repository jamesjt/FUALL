If we accept that the public has jurisdiction over private economic choices, then informal enforcement of economic conformity -- social punishment for outperformance, pressure against conspicuous success -- becomes logically justified.",
    "distilled": "If the public has jurisdiction over private choices, the social enforcement of mediocrity is just democracy working as intended.",
    "notes": "Sumptuary laws -- historical laws regulating personal expenditure on luxury goods, common in medieval and early modern Europe. Mill observes that democracy can produce their informal equivalent. Tocqueville made a similar observation in Democracy in America (1835-1840) about the 'tyranny of the majority' and the pressure toward conformity in American life. The 'bad workmen' passage describes what economists later called 'rate-busting' -- informal worker sanctions against high performers -- a phenomenon extensively documented in the Hawthorne Studies (1924-1932). Mill's 'artizan class' refers to skilled manual workers, the core of the emerging British labor movement."

    "notes": "This passage serves as a transition from Mill's hypothetical examples to his concrete contemporary cases (prohibition, Sabbatarian laws, Mormon persecution). The principle Mill identifies -- banning innocent conduct to suppress disapproved conduct -- is the logic behind many modern regulatory frameworks: banning encryption to prevent crime, restricting cash transactions to prevent tax evasion, surveilling all communications to catch terrorists."

    "refashioned": "Take prohibition. In Mill's time, it was alcohol. The pattern is the same today with every substance, activity, or technology that a determined minority decides the public cannot be trusted with.\n\nThe argument always escalates the same way. A temperance advocate in Mill's era argued that his 'social rights' were violated by the existence of alcohol -- because alcohol causes disorder that threatens his security, creates social costs he is taxed to support, and surrounds him with dangers that impede his moral development. By this logic, every individual has an absolute social right to have every other individual behave perfectly according to the complainer's own standards. Anyone who falls short in the smallest way violates this 'right' and justifies a demand for legislative action.\n\nThis is not a theory of social rights. It is a theory of total control. It recognizes no freedom at all except perhaps the freedom to hold opinions secretly, since the moment any disfavored opinion is spoken aloud, it 'invades' someone's social rights. It gives every person a vested interest in every other person's moral, intellectual, and physical perfection -- defined, naturally, by the claimant's own standards.",
    "elegant": "The prohibitionist's logic always escalates: my right to security is violated by your disorder; my right to equality is violated by the costs your behavior imposes; my right to moral development is impeded by your existence. Follow this logic to its conclusion and every imperfection in every other person becomes a violation of your rights. This is not social rights. It is a blueprint for total control.",
    "summary": "Mill dissects the prohibitionist argument that 'social rights' are violated by others' private behavior. Taken to its logical conclusion, this doctrine gives every person an absolute right to have every other person behave perfectly by the claimant's own standards -- a principle that would justify any interference with liberty whatsoever.",
    "distilled": "The claim that others' imperfect behavior violates your 'social rights' is not a theory of rights but a blueprint for total control.",
    "notes": "Maine Laws -- the first statewide prohibition law, passed in Maine in 1851 under Neal Dow's leadership, later repealed in 1856. The 'Alliance' refers to the United Kingdom Alliance for the Suppression of the Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, founded 1853 in Manchester. Lord Stanley -- Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (1826-1893), a principled moderate who Mill admired. The quoted correspondence between the Alliance secretary and Lord Stanley was a real public exchange. Mill's reductio ad absurdum of the 'social rights' argument anticipates modern critiques of rights inflation -- the tendency to frame every grievance as a rights violation, a pattern identified by Mary Ann Glendon in Rights Talk (1991)."

    "refashioned": "Consider laws mandating a day of rest. The principle behind them is reasonable enough: workers need protection from being forced to work seven days a week. If everyone else works Sundays, the pressure to do the same becomes coercive. So there is a legitimate case for guaranteeing a common day off, based on workers' direct interests.\n\nBut this justification extends only to protecting workers from compulsory labor. It does not extend to dictating what people do with their free time. It does not justify banning entertainment, closing museums, shutting down public transit, or forbidding recreation on that day. The only basis for such restrictions is the belief that certain activities are religiously wrong -- and that is a motive for legislation that should be resisted absolutely.\n\nIt is not society's job to avenge offenses against God. The idea that one person has a duty to ensure another person's religious compliance was the foundation of every religious persecution in history. The impulse behind shutting down Sunday trains and closing museums may lack the old cruelty, but the mentality is identical: an inability to tolerate others doing what your religion forbids, grounded in the belief that God holds you accountable for failing to stop them.",
    "elegant": "Protecting workers from compulsory seven-day labor is legitimate. Dictating what free people do with their day off is not. The only basis for banning Sunday recreation is religious -- and the belief that God holds you accountable for others' sins is the foundation of every religious persecution in history. The cruelty may have softened. The mentality has not.",
    "summary": "Laws guaranteeing a common day of rest are justified to protect workers from coerced labor.

    "notes": "Deorum injuriae Diis curae -- Latin: 'Offenses against the gods are the gods' concern,' from Tacitus, Annals I.73, originally spoken by Emperor Tiberius refusing to prosecute a man accused of blasphemy. Sabbatarian legislation in England -- the Lord's Day Observance Act (various iterations from 1677 onward) restricted Sunday commerce and entertainment. Resistance to Sunday railway travel was a real Victorian controversy; the Lord's Day Observance Society campaigned against it. Museum opening hours on Sundays were contested throughout the 19th century; the National Gallery did not open on Sundays until 1896. Mill's argument distinguishes legitimate labor protection (preventing coerced seven-day work weeks) from illegitimate morals legislation (imposing religious observance through law)."

    "refashioned": "Finally, consider how societies treat religious minorities who practice what the majority finds abhorrent.\n\nMill wrote about the Mormons -- a new religion whose followers were murdered, expelled from their homes, and driven into the desert, where outsiders still debated whether to send military force to compel them to conform. The specific provocation was polygamy, which Mill himself condemned as a violation of liberty -- it shackled one half of the community while liberating the other from mutual obligation.\n\nBut here is the test: the Mormons had retreated to unsettled territory. They had built a community from nothing. They were not imposing their practices on anyone. Members were free to leave. Other countries were not asked to recognize their marriages. On what principle, besides raw tyranny, could outsiders justify forcing them to change?\n\nThe answer is: none. If you object to their practices, send missionaries. Make your case through persuasion. Compete in the marketplace of ideas. But you do not get to use force against a self-governing community that harms no outsiders, simply because their way of life offends you from a thousand miles away.\n\nThe same principle applies to any isolated community whose practices the mainstream finds repugnant. One contemporary writer proposed not a 'crusade' but a 'civilizade' -- a campaign to civilize them by force. But no community has the right to force another to be civilized. If your civilization cannot outcompete what you consider barbarism through the power of its own example, persuasion, and appeal -- if it needs force to survive -- then it deserves to fall. A civilization so fragile that it requires coercion to defend itself against a handful of dissenters in the desert has already rotted from within.",
    "elegant": "The Mormons were murdered, expelled, and driven into the desert -- and still the outside world debated sending armies to force them to conform. On what principle? Not justice. Not self-defense. Only the conviction that distant strangers may be compelled to live as you see fit. If your civilization cannot outcompete what you call barbarism through persuasion and example alone, it deserves to fall. What needs force to survive has already rotted from within.",
    "summary": "Mill uses the persecution of the Mormons as a final test case. Despite retreating to uninhabited territory and harming no outsiders, they still faced threats of military force. Mill condemns this: no community has the right to compel another to conform, no matter how offensive their practices. A civilization that requires force to defend itself against peaceful dissenters has already failed.",
    "distilled": "A civilization that cannot survive without forcing distant dissenters to conform has already failed on its own terms.",
    "notes": "Joseph Smith (1805-1844) -- founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. The Mormon Exodus (1846-1847) -- Brigham Young led the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo, Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. The Utah War (1857-1858) -- a confrontation between Mormon settlers and the U.S. federal government, occurring around the time Mill was writing On Liberty. 'Civilizade' -- Mill's unnamed writer who proposed forcible civilization of the Mormons. Mill's condemnation of polygamy as violating liberty -- specifically women's equality and reciprocal obligation in marriage -- shows his feminism intersecting with his liberalism, influenced by Harriet Taylor Mill. The Western Roman Empire comparison references the fall of Rome (476 CE) and its regeneration through contact with Germanic peoples. Mill's final rhetorical move -- that a civilization needing force to survive deserves to fall -- is one of his most radical statements, challenging imperial and colonial assumptions of his era."
