When a country exports more value than it imports, foreign nations owe it a balance that must be paid in gold and silver, increasing the domestic supply. When imports exceed exports, the reverse occurs -- the country owes a balance to foreigners, which must be paid in precious metals, draining the supply. In such a case, prohibiting bullion export cannot stop the outflow; it only makes smuggling more dangerous and therefore more expensive. This raises the cost of foreign exchange against the deficit country, because merchants buying bills of exchange must compensate bankers not only for the normal costs of shipping money abroad but also for the additional risk imposed by the prohibition. The higher the exchange rate runs against a country, the more the trade balance supposedly worsens -- the country's money loses value relative to foreign money, making imports dearer and exports cheaper, which widens the deficit and accelerates the outflow of gold and silver.",

High exchange rates were certainly costly for merchants needing to make foreign payments -- they paid more for bills of exchange.

The smuggling expense would generally be incurred domestically, rarely causing the export of a single extra coin beyond the exact sum required. Moreover, high exchange rates would naturally motivate merchants to bring their exports and imports into closer balance, to minimize the sums on which they had to pay the premium.

Prudent businessmen whose projects have exceeded their capital are just as likely to lack money and credit as extravagant people whose spending has exceeded their income. Before their ventures can pay off, their capital is gone and their credit with it. They run everywhere trying to borrow money, and everyone tells them there is none to lend. Yet even these widespread complaints do not prove that the normal quantity of coins is not circulating. They prove only that many people want money who have nothing to offer in exchange. When trade profits are unusually high, over-trading becomes a universal error among large and small dealers alike. They do not necessarily send more money abroad, but they buy unusual quantities of goods on credit, both at home and overseas, shipping them to distant markets in the hope that returns will arrive before payment comes due. Payment comes due first, and they have nothing with which to buy money or offer security for loans.

This analysis brings us back, once again, to commodities -- the annual produce of the nation's land and labor -- as the ultimate resource that enabled the country to carry on the war. Such an enormous annual expense could only have been sustained by an enormous annual productive output. In 1761 alone, for instance, war expenses exceeded 19 million pounds. No accumulated stockpile of any kind could have supported such annual expenditure.

A country whose industry produces a large annual surplus of such manufactures for export can sustain a very expensive foreign war for many years without exporting significant quantities of gold and silver -- or even possessing much. A considerable share of its manufactured surplus must, in this case, be exported without bringing returns to the country (though it does bring returns to the merchant), as the government buys merchants' bills on foreign countries to purchase army pay and provisions. But some surplus may still yield returns through normal trade. During wartime, manufacturers face double demand: first, to produce goods for export to pay the army's foreign bills, and second, to produce goods for the usual domestic consumption trade. In the midst of the most destructive foreign war, therefore, most manufactures may flourish greatly -- and conversely decline when peace returns.

It gives value to surpluses by exchanging them for goods that satisfy wants and increase enjoyments. Second, by opening a wider market for whatever part of production exceeds domestic consumption, foreign trade enables the division of labor to be carried to its highest perfection, even in industries where the home market alone would be too small. This encourages nations to improve their productive powers and maximize their annual output, thereby increasing the real revenue and wealth of society. Foreign trade continually performs these great services for all countries involved. All benefit from it, though the country where the merchant resides typically benefits most, since he is generally more occupied in supplying the needs and carrying off the surpluses of his own country.

Fine manufactures, especially those of higher quality, are easily transported from one country to another, far more so than grain or cattle. Foreign trade is chiefly occupied with transporting manufactures. In manufacturing, even a small foreign advantage in cost or quality is sufficient to undersell domestic producers in the home market. In the case of raw agricultural produce, only a very large advantage could achieve the same result. If the free importation of foreign manufactures were permitted, several domestic manufacturing industries would likely suffer, some might be destroyed entirely, and considerable amounts of capital and labor currently employed in them would be forced to find other employment.

The short sea crossing from Ireland makes Irish cattle imports somewhat more practical, but even if permanently allowed, this could have no significant effect on British graziers. The regions bordering the Irish Sea are all grazing country themselves. Irish cattle could never serve their local market but would have to be driven through these extensive regions at great cost before reaching their real destination. Fat cattle could not survive such a long drive, so only lean cattle could be imported, which would affect only breeding regions, not feeding and fattening ones -- indeed, cheaper lean cattle would actually benefit the fattening regions. The small number of Irish cattle imported since the trade was permitted, and the continued strong prices for lean cattle, demonstrate that even Britain's breeding regions have little to fear.

According to the well-informed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, average annual imports total only 23,728 quarters of all grain types -- amounting to just one five-hundred-and-seventy-first part of annual consumption. Moreover, the corn bounty system, by encouraging excessive exports in years of plenty, actually necessitates greater imports during years of scarcity than would otherwise occur. Through the bounty, the abundance of one year does not compensate for the shortage of another. Without the bounty, less grain would be exported in good years, and consequently less would need to be imported in bad years. The corn merchants -- the middlemen who transport grain between Britain and foreign countries -- would lose considerable business and might suffer significantly.

Revenge naturally calls for retaliation -- imposing comparable duties and prohibitions on their manufactures imported into ours. Nations rarely fail to retaliate in this way.\n\nThe French have been particularly aggressive in favoring their own manufactures by restricting competing foreign goods. This was central to the policy of Colbert, who, despite his great abilities, appears to have been deceived by the self-serving arguments of merchants and manufacturers, who always demand monopoly protection against their fellow citizens. It is now the opinion of France's most informed observers that Colbert's protectionist policies did not benefit his country.\n\nBy the tariff of 1667, Colbert imposed very high duties on a great many foreign manufactures. When he refused to moderate them for the Dutch, they prohibited the importation of French wines, brandies, and manufactures in 1671. The war of 1672 appears to have been partly caused by this trade dispute. The Peace of Nijmegen ended it in 1678 by moderating some duties in the Dutch favor, after which the Dutch lifted their prohibition.\n\nAround the same time, France and England began mutually oppressing each other's industry with similar duties and prohibitions -- the French apparently setting the first example. The hostility between the two nations has since prevented either side from moderating these restrictions. In 1697, England prohibited the import of Flemish bone lace. The Flemish government, then under Spanish rule, retaliated by prohibiting English woolens. In 1700, the English prohibition was lifted on condition that English woolens be admitted to Flanders on their former terms.",

When our neighbors prohibit one of our manufactures, we generally prohibit not just the same product from them -- which alone would rarely affect them much -- but some other manufacture of theirs. This may indeed encourage some particular group of our own workers and, by excluding their rivals, enable them to raise prices in the home market.

The corn bounty, like every export bounty, imposes two separate taxes on the people. First, the tax they must pay to fund the bounty. Second, the tax created by higher domestic prices, which, since everyone buys corn, falls on the entire population. This second tax is by far the heavier of the two. Suppose the bounty of five shillings per exported quarter of wheat raises the home market price by only sixpence per bushel, or four shillings per quarter. Even on this very moderate assumption, the public -- besides paying the five-shilling bounty on every quarter exported -- must also pay an additional four shillings on every quarter they themselves consume.",

An export bounty, by enabling them to send their surplus abroad while keeping up the home price, effectively prevents oversupply. It is therefore the mercantilist expedient they are fondest of. I have known manufacturers in certain trades to agree privately to pay an export bounty out of their own pockets on a certain proportion of their goods.

And unless the surplus can normally be exported, growers will never grow more, and importers will never import more, than bare domestic consumption requires. The market will seldom be oversupplied, but will generally be undersupplied -- because those whose business is to supply it will be constantly afraid of being left with unsold stock. Prohibiting exports limits agricultural improvement to what domestic consumption alone demands. Freedom of export enables it to extend cultivation to supply foreign nations as well.\n\nHowever, the exporter's interest can sometimes conflict with the public interest. If his own country is suffering dearth while a neighbor faces famine, it might be in his interest to ship corn in quantities that worsen the domestic dearth. The statutes' true purpose was not to supply the home market abundantly, but to raise corn's money price as high as possible under the pretense of encouraging agriculture -- creating a constant dearth at home.

The unjust oppression of other countries' industry rebounds, so to speak, upon the oppressors and crushes their own industry more than it does that of others. Under these regulations, for example, the Hamburg merchant must ship his linen destined for America to London first, and must also bring back through London the tobacco he wants for the German market, since he can neither ship directly to America nor import directly from there. This probably forces him to sell the linen somewhat cheaper and buy the tobacco somewhat dearer than he otherwise would, reducing his profits. However, in this Hamburg-to-London trade, he receives his capital returns much more quickly than in a direct trade with America, even assuming (which is far from the case) that American payments were as punctual as London's. In this restricted trade, therefore, his capital can continuously employ a much greater quantity of German industry than would be possible in the direct trade from which he is excluded. Though this forced employment may be less profitable for him personally, it cannot be less beneficial to his country. The opposite is true for the London merchant. The colonial monopoly naturally draws his capital into an employment that may be more profitable to him personally but, because of its slow returns, is less beneficial to his country.",

Wool production is not the primary purpose of sheep farming. The sheep farmer expects his profit mainly from the price of the carcass, not the fleece, and the average carcass price will generally compensate for any deficiency in the average fleece price.

In an improved and cultivated country, therefore, their interests as landlords and farmers are not much affected by such regulations, though their interests as consumers may be affected by the resulting rise in food prices.

Since quality depends on the breed, pasture, and management and cleanliness of sheep throughout the entire growth of the fleece, the attention devoted to these factors would naturally correspond to the return the fleece price is likely to provide for that labor and expense. However, the condition of the fleece depends heavily on the health, growth, and size of the animal: the same attention needed to improve the carcass largely suffices to improve the fleece as well.

Since beaver skins were among the enumerated commodities, exports from America were confined to the British market. Manufacturers quickly saw their opportunity: in 1764, the import duty on beaver skins was slashed to just one penny, but the export duty was raised to sevenpence per skin, with no drawback of the import duty.

Subsequent tables represent the distribution under various conditions of restraint and regulation, where either the landlord class or the commercial class is favored over the farming class, encroaching on the share properly belonging to it. Every such encroachment, every violation of the natural distribution that perfect liberty would establish, must -- according to this system -- progressively degrade the total annual output and cause a gradual decline in real national wealth. This decline proceeds faster or slower depending on how severely the natural distribution is violated. These subsequent tables represent the different degrees of decline corresponding to different degrees of distortion.",

Experience, however, suggests that the human body frequently maintains perfect health under a wide variety of regimens -- including some generally considered quite unwholesome. The healthy human body, it seems, contains some unknown principle of self-preservation capable of preventing or correcting the ill effects even of a very poor regimen. Quesnay, who was himself a physician -- and a very theoretical one -- seems to have entertained a similar notion about the political body. He appears to have imagined that it could thrive only under one precise regimen: the exact regimen of perfect liberty and perfect justice. He seems not to have considered that in the political body, the natural effort every person continually makes to improve his own condition is a principle of preservation capable of preventing and correcting many of the ill effects of a partially unjust and oppressive political economy. Such a political economy, though it certainly slows progress, is not always capable of stopping a nation's advance toward wealth -- and still less of making it go backward. If no nation could prosper without perfect liberty and perfect justice, no nation in the world could ever have prospered. In the political body, however, the wisdom of nature has fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects of human folly and injustice -- just as it has done in the natural body for remedying the effects of sloth and intemperance.",

On this ground alone, calling it barren or unproductive seems very inappropriate. We would not call a marriage barren just because it produced only a son and a daughter -- replacing the father and mother without increasing the human population. Farmers certainly produce more, yielding a net surplus (rent) beyond replacing their capital and costs. Just as a marriage producing three children is certainly more productive than one producing two, farm labor is certainly more productive than manufacturing labor. But the superior productiveness of one does not make the other barren.",

Consider an artisan who, in the six months after harvest, does ten pounds' worth of work while consuming ten pounds' worth of food and necessities. He really does add ten pounds to the annual value of the land's output and the society's labor. While consuming a half-year's revenue of ten pounds, he has produced an equal value of work capable of purchasing an equivalent revenue for himself or someone else. The total value consumed and produced during those six months equals not ten but twenty pounds. It is true that no more than ten pounds' worth may have existed at any single moment. But if that ten pounds' worth of food had been consumed by a soldier or household servant instead, the value of goods actually existing at the end of six months would have been ten pounds less than it is thanks to the artisan's labor. Even if what the artisan produces is never, at any single moment, worth more than what he consumes, at every moment the actually existing value of goods in the market is greater than it would be without his labor.",

The one exports what can support only a few but imports the subsistence and comforts of many. The other exports the subsistence of many and imports the comforts of only a few.

    "elegant": "Scotland's herring fishery expanded from 29 busses in 1771 to 294 in 1776, then contracted to 135 by 1781. Catch rates and bounty payments followed a similar rise-and-fall pattern, with bounties reaching nearly 27,000 pounds at peak.",
    "summary": "The herring fishery data shows rapid expansion from 1771 to 1776 followed by contraction, with fleet size, catch volume, and bounty payments all following a boom-and-bust pattern.",
    "distilled": "Scotland's herring fishery boomed from 29 to 294 busses between 1771-1776, then contracted to 135 by 1781, with bounty payments following the same pattern.",
    "notes": "The eleven-year dataset covers the period of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), which disrupted fishing operations and helps explain the decline after 1776. The expansion-contraction pattern illustrates how bounties can stimulate industry but cannot sustain it against adverse conditions. The ratio of barrels caught to barrels carried shows declining efficiency over the period."

The bounty averaged about 8 shillings and 2 1/4 pence per barrel of sea-sticks. But since a barrel of sea-sticks counts as only two-thirds of a fully packed barrel, deducting one-third (126,115 barrels) gives 252,231 barrels fully packed -- bringing the effective bounty to about 12 shillings and 3 3/4 pence per fully packed barrel.",
    "elegant": "Over eleven years: 2,186 busses, 378,347 barrels caught, 165,463 pounds in bounties. Adjusting for the sea-sticks-to-packed-barrel conversion (two-thirds ratio), the effective bounty was about 12 shillings and 3 3/4 pence per fully packed barrel.",
    "summary": "The eleven-year totals show 165,463 pounds paid in bounties on 252,231 fully packed barrel equivalents, yielding an effective bounty of about 12 shillings and 4 pence per barrel after adjusting for the sea-sticks conversion ratio.",
    "distilled": "Over eleven years, the herring bounty averaged about 12 shillings and 4 pence per fully packed barrel equivalent -- a substantial subsidy per unit of output.",
    "notes": "The sea-sticks to fully-packed conversion ratio (2:3) accounts for the fact that herrings lose volume during processing and repacking. At 12s 3.75d per barrel, the bounty was a significant fraction of the total value of the product. These calculations support Smith's argument that the bounty was excessive relative to the economic value generated. Total bounty of 165,463 pounds over eleven years = about 15,000 pounds annually."

    "refashioned": "If the herrings are exported, there is an additional premium of 2 shillings and 8 pence per barrel, making the total government bounty 14 shillings and 11 3/4 pence per barrel in cash. But if we add the duty on the salt typically used in curing each barrel -- at the average rate of one and a quarter bushels of foreign salt at 10 shillings per bushel, totaling 12 shillings and 6 pence -- the total bounty per barrel amounts to 1 pound, 7 shillings, and 5 3/4 pence.",
    "elegant": "Exported herrings received an additional 2s 8d premium, bringing the cash bounty to nearly 15 shillings per barrel. Adding the forgone salt duty (12s 6d for foreign salt used in curing) brings the total effective subsidy to over 1 pound 7 shillings per barrel.",
    "summary": "The total effective bounty on exported herrings, including the export premium and the forgone salt duty, amounted to over 27 shillings per barrel -- a subsidy approaching or exceeding the market value of the herrings themselves.",
    "distilled": "Including export premiums and forgone salt duties, the total effective herring bounty exceeded 27 shillings per barrel -- a massive subsidy relative to the product's value.",
    "notes": "The salt duty component is crucial to the full subsidy calculation. Foreign salt (typically from France or Portugal) was heavily taxed, and the exemption for fishing was effectively an additional bounty. At 1 pound 7 shillings 5.75 pence per barrel, the total subsidy was enormous -- likely approaching or exceeding the market price of the herrings. This supports Smith's argument in Chapter 4.5 that the herring bounty was economically absurd."

Adding the duty on two bushels of Scotch salt at 1 shilling and 6 pence per bushel (the estimated average quantity used per barrel) gives an additional 3 shillings. The total bounty per barrel therefore amounts to 17 shillings and 11 3/4 pence.",
    "elegant": "Herrings cured with British salt instead of foreign received a lower total subsidy -- 17 shillings and 11 3/4 pence per barrel -- because the duty on domestic salt was much lower than on foreign salt.",
    "summary": "Using cheaper British salt instead of taxed foreign salt reduced the total effective bounty to about 18 shillings per barrel, still a substantial subsidy but lower than the foreign-salt equivalent.",
    "distilled": "Herrings cured with British salt received a lower but still substantial effective bounty of about 18 shillings per barrel.",
    "notes": "The difference between foreign salt (12s 6d duty) and Scotch salt (3s duty) illustrates how the salt tax system interacted with the fishing bounty. Scotch salt was much cheaper because it was taxed at only 1s 6d per bushel versus 10s for foreign salt. The lower total bounty for British-salt-cured herrings created an incentive to use domestic salt -- an additional mercantilist preference built into the subsidy system."

But then add back the foreign salt duty of 12 shillings and 6 pence. The total premium for each barrel of herrings entered for domestic consumption therefore amounts to 1 pound, 3 shillings, and 9 3/4 pence.",

    "distilled": "Domestically consumed herrings still received an effective subsidy exceeding 23 shillings per barrel despite a nominal consumption duty.",
    "notes": "The calculation shows that domestic consumption was still heavily subsidized -- the one-shilling duty was token compared to the salt duty exemption. The government was effectively paying more in subsidies and tax exemptions than it collected in consumption duties. This illustrates Smith's broader point about the economic absurdity of the bounty system."

    "notes": "Smith's closing distinction -- that the domestic premium is unambiguously a bounty -- is the analytical punch of the appendix. The government was subsidizing not just exports (which might have a mercantilist rationale) but domestic consumption, which has no trade-policy justification at all. The total subsidy calculations across 4.9.63-4.9.67 demonstrate that the herring bounty was economically irrational at every level. Cross-reference Chapter 4.5 for the theoretical argument these numbers support."

    "summary": "Salt import data for Scotland's fishery shows overwhelming preference for foreign salt over domestic -- nearly six times the volume and even more by weight, given that foreign salt bushels weighed 84 pounds versus 56 for British.

    "notes": "This final table completes the empirical appendix to Book IV. The 5:1 foreign-to-domestic salt ratio shows that the fishery depended heavily on imported salt despite mercantilist preferences for domestic supply. The weight difference (84 lbs vs 56 lbs per bushel) means the volume ratio understates the weight ratio. The salt data connects to the bounty calculations in 4.9.64-4.9.67, showing the magnitude of forgone salt duties. The April-to-April fiscal year was standard British accounting practice."
