A smith who makes nails among other tasks can manage eight hundred to a thousand. But young men who have done nothing but make nails since boyhood can each produce over twenty-three hundred in a day when they apply themselves. And nail-making is far from the simplest operation -- the worker must blow the bellows, tend the fire, heat the iron, and forge every part, changing tools for the head. The operations in pin-making or button-making are much simpler still, and the speed of those who have spent their lives performing them exceeds what anyone who has not witnessed it would believe the human hand capable of.",

Through specialization, each worker's mind is naturally directed toward one simple object, and it is reasonable to expect that some workers in each branch of production will find easier and quicker ways of doing their particular job. Many of the machines used in the most subdivided industries were originally invented by ordinary workers who, occupied with a single simple operation, naturally thought about how to do it more easily and quickly. Visitors to such factories are frequently shown ingenious machines invented by the workers themselves. In the early steam engines, for instance, a boy was employed full-time to open and close the valve between the boiler and the cylinder as the piston moved up and down. One such boy, eager to play with his friends, noticed that by tying a string from the valve handle to another part of the machine, the valve would operate automatically, freeing him to go play. One of the greatest improvements ever made to the steam engine was thus the discovery of a boy who wanted to avoid work.",

Assaying -- determining the metal's purity -- is even more difficult and time-consuming, requiring the metal to be melted with chemical agents, without which the results are unreliable. Before coined money, buyers were constantly vulnerable to fraud -- receiving adulterated metal disguised to look genuine instead of pure silver or copper. To prevent such fraud, facilitate exchange, and thereby encourage industry and commerce, every significantly developed nation found it necessary to stamp certified quantities of commonly used metals with a public mark.

But wages in a major city and its vicinity are frequently a quarter or a fifth higher -- twenty or twenty-five percent -- than just a few miles away. Eighteenpence a day may be considered the standard price of labor in London and its neighborhood. A few miles out, it drops to fourteen or fifteen pence. Tenpence may be reckoned the going rate in Edinburgh and its surroundings. A few miles from there, it falls to eightpence -- the typical wage across most of lowland Scotland, where it varies much less than in England. Such differences in wages, which seem insufficient to motivate a person to move from one parish to another, would -- if they existed in commodity prices -- cause an enormous transportation of the bulkiest goods from one end of the kingdom to the other, quickly equalizing prices. After everything that has been said about the fickleness and inconstancy of human nature, experience makes it abundantly clear that a human being is, of all kinds of freight, the most difficult to transport.

Grain -- the staple food of the common people -- is more expensive in Scotland than in England, since Scotland regularly imports large quantities of English corn. But English corn must sell for more in Scotland (the importing country) than in England (the exporting country), and in terms of quality it cannot be priced higher than competing Scottish grain. English grain is so much superior in flour yield that, although it often appears dearer by volume, it is usually cheaper by quality or weight. The price of labor, however, is lower in Scotland than in England. If the laboring poor can support their families in England, they must be living even better relative to their costs in the cheaper-labor regions. Oatmeal does furnish the common people of Scotland with most of their food, which is generally inferior to the diet of their English counterparts. But this dietary difference is the effect of the wage difference, not its cause. By a common misunderstanding, I have frequently heard it presented the other way around.

The growth of capital, which raises wages, tends to lower profits.

It is affected not only by every price change in the goods he deals in, but by the fortune of his rivals and his customers, and by a thousand other accidents to which goods are liable whether transported by sea or land, or even stored in a warehouse. Profit therefore varies not only from year to year, but from day to day, and almost from hour to hour. To determine the average profit across all trades in a great nation must be far more difficult; and to judge what it may have been in former times or distant periods, with any precision, is altogether impossible.",

When a country's capital is insufficient for all the new business that such acquisitions open up to its various citizens, it is directed toward whichever branches offer the greatest profit. Some capital that had previously been employed in other trades is necessarily withdrawn and redirected into the new, more profitable ones. In all those older trades, competition therefore decreases. The market becomes less fully supplied with many goods, whose prices necessarily rise, yielding greater profits to those who deal in them -- who can therefore afford to borrow at higher interest. For some time after the conclusion of the recent war, not only private individuals of the best credit but some of the greatest companies in London commonly borrowed at five percent, having previously paid no more than four to four and a half percent. The great expansion of both territory and trade from our acquisitions in North America and the West Indies sufficiently explains this, without assuming any reduction in the nation's total capital. So vast an addition of new business to be managed with the existing capital must necessarily have reduced the amount employed in many particular trades, in which less competition meant higher profits.

Where the typical earnings of most manufacturers are roughly level with common labor wages, those of masons and bricklayers are generally fifty to one hundred percent higher. Where common laborers earn four or five shillings a week, masons and bricklayers frequently earn seven or eight; where the former earn six, the latter often earn nine or ten; and where the former earn nine or ten, as in London, the latter commonly earn fifteen to eighteen.

His high wages arise entirely from the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment is generally as steady as he wishes.

In a recent inquiry into their condition, it was found that at their prevailing rates they could earn six to ten shillings a day. Six shillings is about four times common labor wages in London, and in every trade the lowest common earnings represent those of the vast majority.

Those who pay no more than this evidently pay no more than the real value of the risk -- the lowest price at which insurance can reasonably be offered. Yet though many people have made modest money from insurance, very few have made great fortunes from it, which strongly suggests that the typical balance of profit and loss in insurance is no better than in other trades. Moderate though insurance premiums are, many people consider the risk too small to bother paying them. Averaging across the entire kingdom, nineteen houses out of twenty -- or perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred -- are not insured against fire. Maritime risk alarms more people, and a higher proportion of ships is insured. Yet many ships sail at all seasons, even in wartime, without any insurance. This may sometimes be reasonable: when a large company or merchant has twenty or thirty ships at sea, they can effectively insure each other, and the premiums saved across the fleet may more than cover any likely losses.

As any commodity's price rises above the ordinary or average level, the profits of at least some of the capital used in bringing it to market rise above their normal level, and as it falls, they sink below it. All commodities are subject to price variations, but some much more so than others. In all goods produced by human industry, the annual output is naturally regulated by annual demand so that average production roughly matches average consumption. In some industries, the same amount of labor always produces roughly the same quantity of goods -- in the linen or woolen manufactures, for example, the same number of workers will process nearly the same quantity of cloth year after year. Price variations in such goods arise only from fluctuations in demand -- a period of public mourning, for instance, raises the price of black cloth. But since demand for most plain linen and wool is fairly stable, so are their prices. Other industries, however, produce wildly different quantities from the same labor input year to year. The same effort will produce very different amounts of grain, wine, hops, sugar, and tobacco depending on conditions. Prices for these goods fluctuate with both demand variations and the much larger variations in supply, making them extremely volatile. The profits of dealers in such commodities must therefore fluctuate with their prices. Speculative merchants focus precisely on these volatile commodities, buying when they expect prices to rise and selling when they expect them to fall.",

The following example, however, involves something similar in the capital of a very rich one. There is no city in Europe where house rents are higher than in London, and yet I know of no capital where a furnished apartment can be rented so cheaply. Lodging is not only much cheaper in London than in Paris; it is much cheaper than in Edinburgh for comparable quality. And, remarkably, the very dearness of house rents is the cause of cheap lodging.\n\nLondon's expensive rents arise partly from the usual causes that make housing dear in all great capitals -- costly labor, expensive building materials that must come from distant places, and above all the dearness of land, with every landlord acting as a monopolist and often charging more for one acre of poor urban land than could be gotten for a hundred acres of the best farmland. But rents also arise partly from the peculiar English custom that requires every head of household to rent an entire house from top to bottom. An English dwelling-house means everything under one roof. In France, Scotland, and much of Europe, it often means just a single floor. A London tradesman must rent a whole house in the neighborhood where his customers live. His shop occupies the ground floor, and he and his family sleep in the attic. He then tries to offset part of his rent by letting the middle floors to lodgers. He expects to support his family through his trade, not through his lodgers.

Country wages have moved closer to manufacturing wages, and agricultural profits closer to trading and manufacturing profits, compared to the previous century or the beginning of the current one.

The capital accumulated in towns eventually grows so large that it can no longer earn its former rate of profit in urban industries alone. Like every other industry, urban industry has its limits, and the accumulation of capital, by increasing competition, inevitably reduces profit. Falling urban profits force capital out to the countryside, where it creates new demand for rural labor and necessarily raises rural wages. Capital then spreads, so to speak, across the face of the land, and by being employed in agriculture, is partly restored to the country at whose expense it had originally been accumulated in the towns. I shall endeavor to show later that the greatest improvements throughout European agriculture have resulted from such overflows of capital originally accumulated in towns, and at the same time to demonstrate that though some countries have achieved considerable wealth by this process, it is inherently slow, uncertain, vulnerable to countless disruptions, and in every respect contrary to the natural and rational order.

Fourth, by being hired for a year and completing the full year of service. However, no one can gain settlement through either of the first two methods without the parish's active consent.

None of this can happen without a certificate. These same reasons strongly discourage parishes from granting certificates in ordinary cases, since they will more likely than not get the certificated persons back in worse condition.' The lesson, Burn concludes, is that certificates should always be demanded by receiving parishes but seldom granted by sending parishes. 'There is something harsh in this certificate system,' says the same author in his History of the Poor Laws, 'in that it gives a parish officer the power to imprison a person for life, as it were, however inconvenient it may be for them to remain in the place where they had the misfortune to acquire what is called a settlement, or whatever advantage they might gain from living elsewhere.'",

In such countries, wages may rise somewhat near a large town or wherever there is extraordinary demand for labor, and decline gradually with distance, falling back to the common rate. But we never encounter the sudden, inexplicable differences in wages between neighboring places that we sometimes find in England, where it is often harder for a poor person to cross the artificial boundary of a parish than to cross an arm of the sea or a ridge of high mountains -- natural boundaries that sometimes separate quite different wage rates in other countries.",

Whenever the legislature tries to regulate disputes between masters and workers, its advisors are always the masters. When the resulting regulation favors workers, it is always just and fair; when it favors masters, it is sometimes not.

But the 8th of George III favors the masters. When masters combine to reduce wages, they typically make a private agreement not to pay above a certain amount, with a penalty for violation. If workers made a similar agreement not to accept below a certain wage, the law would punish them severely. If the law dealt impartially, it would treat masters the same way.

But where there is no such monopoly, free competition will regulate the price far better than any assize. The method of setting the bread assize established by the 31st year of George II could not be applied in Scotland due to a legal deficiency: its enforcement depended on the office of clerk of the market, which did not exist there. This defect was not corrected until the 3rd year of George III. The absence of an assize caused no noticeable problems, and its establishment in the few places where it has been introduced has produced no noticeable benefit. In most Scottish towns, however, there is a bakers' incorporation that claims exclusive privileges, though these are not strictly enforced. The proportion between the rates of wages and profit in different employments of labor and capital does not appear to be much affected, as has already been noted, by whether society is growing richer or poorer, advancing or declining.

Columella, reporting this view, did not dispute it but suggested a frugal alternative: a hedge of brambles and briars, which he had found by experience to be both lasting and impenetrable -- though apparently unknown in Democritus's time. Palladius adopted Columella's view, which Varro had previously recommended. By the judgment of these ancient authorities, garden produce barely sufficed to cover the extra costs of cultivation and irrigation -- for in such sun-drenched countries, it was thought essential then as now to have a water supply for every garden bed. Throughout most of Europe today, a kitchen garden still does not warrant better enclosure than what Columella recommended.

But even allowing half the weight of potatoes to be water -- a very generous estimate -- an acre of potatoes still produces six thousand pounds of solid nourishment: three times what an acre of wheat yields.

The cost of coal where it is consumed must therefore generally be somewhat lower than the cost of wood.\n\nThe price of wood varies with the state of agriculture in much the same way and for the same reasons as the price of cattle. In a country's early stages, most of the land is covered with forest, which is a mere nuisance to the landlord, who would happily give it away to anyone who would cut it. As agriculture advances, the woods are partly cleared by the spread of tillage and partly decay because of increasing cattle herds. Cattle, though they do not multiply as rapidly as corn -- which is entirely the product of human effort -- do increase under human care. People store up feed in times of plenty for seasons of scarcity, provide more food year-round than nature offers, and destroy the cattle's natural predators. Large herds wandering through the woods do not destroy old trees but prevent young ones from growing, so that over a century or two the entire forest is ruined. Wood then becomes scarce and its price rises. It yields a good rent, and the landlord sometimes finds that his best land cannot be employed more profitably than in growing timber, where the size of the profit often compensates for the long wait for returns. This appears to be the current situation in several parts of Britain, where the profit from planting matches that of corn or pasture. The landlord's advantage from planting can never long exceed the rent that corn or pasture would yield, and in an inland, well-cultivated country it will often come close to that rent.

Until 1736, the Spanish king's tax amounted to one-fifth of the refined silver, which until then could be considered the effective rent of most Peruvian silver mines -- the richest known in the world. Without this tax, that fifth would naturally have gone to the landowner, and many mines that could not bear the tax would have been workable. The Duke of Cornwall's tax on tin supposedly exceeds five percent, or one-twentieth of the value, and that proportion would also naturally belong to the mine owner if tin were duty-free. Adding one-twentieth to one-sixth, we find that the total average rent of Cornwall's tin mines was to that of Peru's silver mines as thirteen to twelve. But Peru's silver mines can no longer even pay that low rent, and in 1736 the silver tax was cut from one-fifth to one-tenth. Even this reduced silver tax tempts more smuggling than the one-twentieth tax on tin, and smuggling is naturally much easier with a precious metal than with a bulky commodity. The Spanish king's tax is said to be very poorly collected, while the Duke of Cornwall's is very well collected. Rent therefore probably represents a larger share of tin's price at the most fertile tin mines than silver's price at the most fertile silver mines in the world. After replacing the capital invested in working these different mines along with its ordinary profits, the residual going to the mine owner is greater for the coarser metal than for the precious one.",

Peru could no longer sustain even this, so the silver tax was halved in 1736. Smuggling further erodes silver revenues.

Sometimes, however, the landlord stipulated the right to demand either the annual payment in kind or a fixed sum of money in its place. The price at which the in-kind payment was converted to money is called in Scotland the 'conversion price.' Since the landlord always had the option of taking either the goods or the cash, the conversion price needed to be set below the average market price for the tenant's protection. In many places, accordingly, it was set at barely half the market price. This custom persists in much of Scotland for poultry and in some places for cattle. It might have continued for corn as well, had the institution of the public fiars not replaced it. These fiars are annual valuations, determined by a jury, of the average price of every type and quality of grain, based on actual market prices in each county. This institution made it safe enough for tenants, and far more convenient for landlords, to convert corn rents at the current year's fiar price rather than at a fixed amount. But writers who collected ancient corn prices seem frequently to have mistaken the conversion price for the actual market price. Fleetwood himself acknowledges on one occasion that he made this mistake. Since he wrote his book for a particular purpose, however, he waits until after citing this conversion price fifteen times before making the admission. The price in question was eight shillings per quarter of wheat. In 1423, when his citations begin, this sum contained the same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings in present money. But by 1562, where his citations end, it contained no more silver than eight shillings does today.",

That these goods were proportionally much cheaper than corn in times of poverty and barbarism is undoubtedly true. But this cheapness did not result from silver being more valuable; it resulted from those commodities being less valuable. The reason was not that silver could then purchase or represent more labor, but that such goods could purchase or represent much less labor than in times of greater prosperity and development. Silver is certainly cheaper in Spanish America than in Europe -- cheaper in the producing country than in one to which it must be carried at great expense by land and sea, with freight and insurance costs. Yet, as Ulloa reports, an ox chosen from a herd of three or four hundred could recently be had at Buenos Aires for twenty-one and a half pence sterling. And according to Mr. Byron, a good horse in Santiago, Chile, cost sixteen shillings sterling.

In Great Britain, by contrast, the real compensation of labor -- the actual quantities of necessities and comforts given to the worker -- has increased considerably during the present century.

This tax was originally one-half; it was then reduced to one-third, then to one-fifth, and finally to one-tenth, where it remains.

The interest of dealers in any particular trade or manufacture is always in some respects different from, and even opposed to, that of the public. To widen the market and narrow the competition is always the dealers' interest.
