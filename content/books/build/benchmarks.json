    "original": "THE SUBJECT of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, so unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far from being new, that, in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more civilized portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment.",
    "refashioned": "This essay revisits a question that has been a constant tension throughout history: what are the proper limits of authority over the individual? As political structures, social dynamics, and technology evolve, these limits must be continually reassessed.",
    "elegant": "The subject of this essay is not free will vs determinism but the Right limits of authority over individuals. A question as old as history, yet one that requires frequnect reconsideration as technology and society progress.",

    "distilled": "Not free will, but what authority over individuals is just—and why progress forces us to revisit it.",

    "original": "The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the Government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed on by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying upon the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways.",
    "refashioned": "Through most of history, the struggle between liberty and authority —whether in Greece, Rome, or England— was a struggle between the governed and their rulers. Liberty meant constraining rulers, who were assumed to stand in natural opposition to the people: a king, a caste, or a conquering group whose authority did not rest on the consent of the governed. Their power was seen as necessary to maintain order, yet it was also dangerous—the same force meant to preserve peace could shield corruption and suppress legitimate dissent. Limiting this power was the essence of what was called liberty, and it was pursued in two primary ways: recognized <b>Rights</b> and <b>Constitutional Checks.</b>",
    "elegant": "The tension between liberty and authority runs through history, notably in Greece, Rome, and England. Authority, often rooted in conquest or inheritance, was tolerated for the order it provided, even as it preyed upon the people. To restrain it, and to guide rebellion, two principles were formed.",
    "summary": "History shows a recurring struggle between liberty and authority. Rulers were necessary but exploitative, and two main principles arose to check their power.",
    "distilled": "Liberty vs authority has long shaped history; rulers were both needed and dangerous, so two checks on their power emerged.",

These protections were often upheld through legal safeguards that prevented rulers from imposing unfair penalties.

    "original": "THE TIME, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would be necessary of the “liberty of the press” as one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government. No argument, we may suppose, can now be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them, and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to hear. This aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it needs not be specially insisted on in this place. Though the law of England, on the subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of the Tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force against political discussion, except during some temporary panic, when fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from their propriety;\n*1 and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional countries, to be apprehended, that the government, whether completely responsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control the expression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ of the general intolerance of the public. Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it.",

Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.",

If the suppressed view is correct, both present and future generations lose the opportunity to exchange error for truth.

    "original": "First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its truth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that\ntheir certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not the worse for being common.\n\nUnfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment, which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. Absolute princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all subjects. People more happily situated, who sometimes hear their opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they habitually defer: for in proportion to a man’s want of confidence in his own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of “the world” in general. And the world, to each individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his party, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age. Nor is his faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, and even now think, the exact reverse. He devolves upon his own world the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient worlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance, and that the same causes which make him a Churchman in London, would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Pekin. Yet it is as evident in itself, as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no more infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as certain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present.",
    "refashioned": "History is crowded with authorities—rulers, churches, parties, classes, majorities—suppressing speech they confidently deem false, yet we have repeatedly seen such powers proven wrong. Many beliefs once shielded from challenge are now recognized as not only false but absurd. Too often, people mistake personal or group confidence for absolute certainty. To silence discussion because one is sure an opinion is erroneous is to assume infallibility, and that assumption alone condemns suppression. No authority is entitled to decide for all humankind what may be censored and to deny others the means of judging, for this withholds from them the opportunity to think for themselves. Just as earlier ages found the convictions of their powers in error, we should expect fallibility in some of the high-confidence beliefs of our own time and ensure that individuals who challenge prevailing opinion are protected—even if those challenges do nothing more than reaffirm the confidence in our beliefs.\n\nAuthority, whether drawn from a throne or from the collective, is frequently reluctant to revise itself because of the power it wields. Royalty and aristocracy have long lived in circles where few dare to question them, and communities likewise suffer from the pressures of group-think, conformity, and the human desire for belonging. These forces discourage individuals from challenging the judgments of “the world,” even though open examination is the surest path to clearer truth.\n\nZZY Note: For this reason, we hold Socrates in such esteem, and Plato's stories of him illustrate a timeless lesson: a fundamental of wisdom is to measure our confidence accurately, to accept ignorance, and to welcome the scrutiny that can free us from it. Even when objections are mistaken, they serve truth by compelling it to justify itself more clearly.",
