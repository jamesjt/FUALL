Even in England, where press laws technically remain as restrictive as under the Tudors, the real risk of government censorship of political speech is minimal -- except in moments of collective panic, when fear overrides principle. In functioning democracies, government rarely tries to suppress opinion on its own initiative. When it does, it acts as an instrument of something more dangerous: the intolerance of the public itself.\n\nSo let us set aside the easy case of a government opposed to its people. Suppose instead a government perfectly aligned with popular will, suppressing only what the majority wants suppressed. I deny its right to do so. That power is illegitimate no matter who wields it. The best government has no more title to silence dissent than the worst. Coercion of opinion is most dangerous precisely when it reflects popular sentiment -- because then it faces the least resistance.",

    "refashioned": "The claim that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of those pleasant falsehoods that people repeat until it passes for common sense, while all of history refutes it. The record is full of truths that persecution destroyed -- or at least delayed by centuries.\n\nLook at religious history alone. Movements toward reformation arose at least twenty times before Luther succeeded. Arnold of Brescia was crushed. Fra Dolcino was crushed. Savonarola was crushed. The Albigensians were crushed. The Waldensians were crushed. The Lollards were crushed. The Hussites were crushed. Even after Luther, wherever persecution was sustained with sufficient force, it succeeded. Protestantism was eradicated in Spain, Italy, Flanders, and the Austrian Empire. It would likely have been eradicated in England too, had Queen Mary lived longer or Queen Elizabeth died sooner.\n\nPersecution has always worked unless the persecuted group was simply too large to suppress. Christianity itself might easily have been extinguished in the Roman Empire. It survived not because truth has some magical resilience, but because the persecutions were intermittent -- occasional crackdowns separated by long periods of relatively undisturbed growth.\n\nIt is sentimental nonsense to believe that truth, merely by being true, possesses some inherent advantage over falsehood. People fight for error just as passionately as for truth. Sufficient legal or social pressure will stop the spread of either. The only real advantage truth has is this: when suppressed, it tends to be rediscovered. Kill it once, twice, ten times -- eventually someone will arrive at the same insight again. And if that rediscovery happens to occur at a moment when conditions are favorable, it may gain enough ground to survive all subsequent attempts at suppression.",

The legal assumption was that an oath from someone who did not believe in God was worthless, which is both historically ignorant (many of history's most honorable figures have been nonbelievers) and self-defeating: the rule admits the testimony of every atheist willing to lie about their beliefs while rejecting those honest enough to admit them.\n\nA rule that punishes honesty and rewards deception, that excludes people from legal protection precisely because they demonstrate the integrity that proves them trustworthy, survives only as a badge of hostility -- a relic of persecution.
