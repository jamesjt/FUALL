Now the harder question: should they also be free to act on those opinions, to live according to them, so long as they do so at their own risk?\n\nThe answer is yes, but with a critical qualification. Actions are not as free as opinions. Even opinions lose their protection when they become direct incitements to harm -- the same statement published in a newspaper is protected speech, but shouted to an angry crowd outside someone's home, it becomes something else entirely. Acts that cause unjustifiable harm to others can and must be restrained.\n\nBut when someone's choices affect only themselves, the same logic that protects free thought protects free action. We are fallible. Our collective wisdom is partial at best. Agreement born from suppressing dissent is worthless. And diversity of thought is not a defect to be corrected but a resource to be preserved -- at least until we become far better at grasping the full complexity of truth.\n\nIf different opinions are valuable while humanity remains imperfect, then so are different experiments in living. People should have the freedom to test different ways of life, provided they do not injure others, and let the results speak for themselves. In short: where your choices do not primarily affect others, individuality should prevail. When traditions and social customs dictate your life rather than your own character, something essential to both personal happiness and social progress is missing.",
    "elegant": "Free thought without free action is an incomplete liberty. The same fallibility that demands we tolerate dissenting opinions demands we tolerate dissenting lives. Our truths are half-truths; our customs are experiments that succeeded once, somewhere, for someone. If diversity of thought is valuable in an imperfect world, then so is diversity of living. Let people try different paths and let results, not conformity, be the judge. Where custom rules in place of character, both happiness and progress wither at the root.",

The majority, comfortable with the world as it is (since they are the ones who shaped it), cannot see why their way of life should not be good enough for everyone. Worse, even reformers tend to view individual spontaneity not as a resource but as an obstacle -- something that gets in the way of implementing whatever they have decided is best for society.\n\nOutside Germany, few people have grasped the principle that Wilhelm von Humboldt made the foundation of an entire treatise: that the ultimate purpose of human life is the fullest, most harmonious development of one's capacities into a complete whole.

A person who does something solely because others do it makes no choice at all. Like a muscle that atrophies from disuse, the mind weakens when it is never asked to decide for itself.

Desires and impulses are as much a part of a complete human being as beliefs and restraints. Strong impulses are dangerous only when they are unbalanced -- when one set of drives develops while others that should accompany them remain weak. People do not act badly because their desires are strong; they act badly because their conscience is weak. There is no natural link between strong impulses and poor self-governance. The connection runs the other way.\n\nTo say someone has stronger and more varied desires than average is simply to say they have more raw material to work with -- more capacity for both harm and good, but certainly more capacity for good. Strong impulses are just another word for energy, and an energetic nature will always yield more than a passive one. The same intensity that fuels powerful personal drives also fuels the deepest love of virtue and the most rigorous self-discipline.\n\nSociety should cultivate this energy, not reject the raw material from which exceptional people are made simply because it does not know how to shape them. A person whose desires and impulses genuinely express their own developed nature has character. One whose desires are not their own has no more character than an engine.

And increasingly, this mass does not even take its opinions from leaders, thinkers, or books. Its thinking is done by people just like its members, speaking through media in real time, reacting in the moment.\n\nThis is not necessarily a complaint. Given the current state of human development, mass governance may be unavoidable. But mediocre governance is still mediocre.

Today, individuals are lost in the crowd, and public opinion rules through sheer mass.

No democracy has ever risen above mediocrity except when it let itself be guided by exceptional individuals. Every great initiative begins with one person. The genius can claim only the freedom to point the way -- never to compel. But when conformity is the reigning power, even the bare act of nonconformity becomes a service.

The 'hero-worship' Mill distances himself from refers to Thomas Carlyle's On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1841), which argued that great individuals are the driving force of history. Mill agrees that progress requires exceptional individuals but insists they must lead by persuasion, never by coercion.

If a person has reasonable sense and experience, their own way of arranging their life is the best way -- not because it is objectively superior, but because it is theirs. People are not interchangeable. You cannot even buy a well-fitting coat off the rack without either custom tailoring or a vast selection.

You may freely like or dislike sports, music, or card games -- because both sides are too numerous to silence. But anyone accused of doing 'what nobody does' or failing to do 'what everybody does' is treated as if they had committed a moral offense. Only wealth, status, or institutional protection allows people to live as they choose without paying a social price. And even then, the latitude is narrow.

It stands in constant opposition to every impulse toward something better -- whether that impulse is called the spirit of liberty, the spirit of progress, or the spirit of improvement.\n\nThese spirits are related but not identical. The spirit of improvement sometimes tries to force progress on unwilling people, and the spirit of liberty may temporarily ally with opponents of improvement to resist such coercion. But the only reliable and permanent source of improvement is liberty, because liberty creates as many independent centers of innovation as there are free individuals.\n\nThe contest between custom and progress is the central drama of human history. Most of the world, strictly speaking, has no history at all, because custom won completely. Throughout much of Asia and the Middle East, custom became the final authority on everything -- justice, right, conduct. The result is visible. These civilizations were once the most advanced on earth. They invented writing, agriculture, architecture, and governance while the ancestors of modern Europeans wandered in forests. But they stopped progressing. When? When they ceased to possess individuality.\n\nIf Europe faces a similar fate, it will take a different form. The threat is not stagnation in the traditional sense. Modern Western societies proscribe uniqueness but embrace change -- so long as everyone changes together. Fashion shifts constantly, but everyone must follow the same fashion. We adopt new technologies but discard them on schedule. We pursue improvement in politics, education, even morals -- though moral improvement mostly means persuading or forcing others to be more like us.\n\nWe do not object to progress. We object to individuality. We would consider it an achievement to make everyone alike, forgetting that it is precisely the differences between people that reveal the limitations of any single type and point toward something better.\n\nChina stands as the cautionary example. A nation of considerable talent and even wisdom, equipped early on with an excellent set of customs designed by thinkers any civilization would respect, and possessing a sophisticated system for ensuring that the best-educated citizens occupy positions of authority. If any nation had discovered the formula for permanent progress, it was China. Instead, China became static for centuries, and any future improvement would have to come from outside influences.\n\nChina succeeded spectacularly at what modern conformist culture is working toward: making everyone think and act by the same rules. And these are the fruits. The modern regime of public opinion is, in disorganized form, what the Chinese system was in organized form.
