Thucydides notes that the Peloponnesians generally left the field in summer to return home for harvest. Roman citizens served similarly under their kings and during the early republic.

To reduce this threat, according to some historians Diocletian, according to others Constantine, first withdrew these armies from the frontier, where they had always been stationed in large bodies of two or three legions each, and dispersed them in small units throughout provincial towns. Rarely moved from these posts, small groups of soldiers quartered in trading and manufacturing towns themselves became tradesmen, craftsmen, and manufacturers.

The monopoly is more or less strict depending on how difficult the admission terms are and how much power the directors have to channel most of the trade to themselves and their friends. In the oldest regulated companies, apprenticeship privileges worked the same as in other guilds: someone who had served their time under a company member could become a member themselves, either for free or for a much smaller fee than others paid. The usual corporate spirit prevails in all regulated companies wherever the law does not restrain it.

In 1643, 1645, and 1661, the clothiers and free traders of western England complained to Parliament that the company was acting as a monopoly, confining trade and oppressing manufacturers. Though these complaints produced no legislation, they probably intimidated the company enough to force reform. Since then, at least, there have been no complaints against them. By the statute of William III, the Russia Company's admission fee was reduced to five pounds, and by the statute of Charles II, the Eastland Company's to forty shillings, while Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and all northern Baltic countries were exempted from the Eastland Company's charter. The conduct of these companies had probably prompted these parliamentary acts. Before that time, Sir Josiah Child had described both companies and the Hamburg Company as extremely oppressive, blaming their bad management for the poor state of trade with countries under their respective charters. But though such companies may no longer be very oppressive in current times, they are certainly altogether useless.

The decline of general trade may actually benefit their own private dealings by reducing the number of competitors, allowing them to buy cheaper and sell dearer. The directors of a joint-stock company, by contrast, share only in profits made on the common stock they manage and have no separate private trade whose interest can diverge from the company's general trade.

In a joint-stock company, by contrast, no member can demand payment of his share from the company, but each member can, without the company's consent, transfer his share to another person and thereby introduce a new member.

In a joint-stock company, by contrast, each partner is liable only to the extent of his share.\n\nA joint-stock company's trade is always managed by a court of directors. This court is frequently subject, in many respects, to the control of a general court of proprietors. But most proprietors rarely pretend to understand anything about the company's business. When the spirit of faction does not prevail among them, they take no trouble about it and contentedly accept whatever half-yearly or yearly dividend the directors think proper to pay. This total exemption from trouble and from risk beyond a limited sum encourages many people to invest in joint-stock companies who would never hazard their fortunes in any private partnership. Such companies therefore commonly attract much larger pools of capital than any private partnership can boast. The South Sea Company's trading stock once exceeded thirty-three million eight hundred thousand pounds. The Bank of England's divided capital currently stands at ten million seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds. The directors of such companies, however, being managers of other people's money rather than their own, cannot be expected to watch over it with the same anxious vigilance that partners in a private firm frequently bring to their own funds. Like the stewards of a rich man, they tend to consider attention to small matters beneath their master's dignity, and easily excuse themselves from bothering with it. Negligence and extravagance must therefore always prevail, more or less, in managing such a company's affairs. This is why joint-stock companies in foreign trade have rarely been able to compete against private adventurers. They have accordingly seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege, and frequently have not succeeded even with one. Without an exclusive privilege, they have generally mismanaged the trade. With one, they have both mismanaged and confined it.",
    "elegant": "In partnerships, partners face unlimited liability; in joint-stock companies, liability is limited to one's share. This limited liability, combined with passive ownership and delegated management, attracts vast capital pools -- but creates an inherent governance problem. Directors managing other people's money lack the vigilance of partners managing their own. Like a rich man's stewards, they neglect details and tolerate waste. Joint-stock companies therefore rarely compete successfully against private firms in foreign trade. Without monopoly privileges they mismanage; with them, they both mismanage and restrict trade.",
    "summary": "Joint-stock companies attract vast capital through limited liability and passive ownership, but their directors, managing other people's money, inevitably lack the vigilance of private partners. This is why they have rarely succeeded in foreign trade without monopoly privileges -- and even with privileges, they both mismanage and confine the trade.",

The steward analogy ('managers of other people's money') is foundational to modern corporate governance theory. The observation that limited liability attracts capital but undermines management discipline anticipates Jensen and Meckling's agency theory (1976). The South Sea Company and Bank of England figures provide concrete scale. The final verdict -- without monopoly they mismanage, with monopoly they mismanage and confine -- is devastating."

But even with this heavy tax on competitors, the company still could not maintain the competition. Its stock and credit gradually declined. By 1712, its debts had grown so large that a special act of Parliament was needed to protect both the company and its creditors, requiring a two-thirds supermajority of creditors (by number and value) to approve any debt restructuring terms. By 1730, its affairs were in such disorder that it was completely unable to maintain its forts and garrisons -- the sole purpose and pretext of its existence. From that year until its final dissolution, Parliament found it necessary to grant an annual subsidy of ten thousand pounds for that purpose. In 1732, after years of losses in the business of transporting enslaved people to the West Indies, the company finally abandoned that trade altogether, selling its human cargo to private traders for transport to America, and redirecting its servants to an inland African trade in gold dust, ivory, and dyeing materials.",

The fraud and excess of its stock-jobbing schemes are well enough known, and explaining them here would be beside the point. Its trading ventures were not much better managed. Its first trade was supplying enslaved people to the Spanish West Indies under the Assiento Contract granted by the Treaty of Utrecht, over which it held an exclusive privilege. But since this trade was not expected to be very profitable -- both the Portuguese and French companies that had previously held it on the same terms had been ruined by it -- the company was also allowed, as compensation, to send one ship of a certain size annually to trade directly with the Spanish West Indies. Of the ten voyages this annual ship was permitted to make, the company is said to have profited considerably by only one -- that of the Royal Caroline in 1731 -- and to have lost money on nearly all the rest. Its agents blamed the Spanish government's extortion and oppression, but the losses were probably owed mainly to the extravagance and embezzlement of those very agents, some of whom reportedly amassed great fortunes in a single year.

The competition between the two companies, along with private traders, is said to have nearly ruined both. Later, in 1750, when a proposal was made to Parliament to reorganize the trade under a regulated company and thereby open it up somewhat, the East India Company argued strenuously against it. They described, in vivid terms, what they considered the miserable effects of the earlier competition. In India, they said, competition had driven up the price of goods so high that they were not worth buying; and in England, by overstocking the market, it had driven prices so low that no profit could be made. That this competition supplied English consumers more plentifully and cheaply, to the great advantage of the public, can hardly be doubted. But whether it really raised prices significantly in the Indian market seems improbable, since all the extra demand this competition could generate would have been like a drop of water in the immense ocean of Indian commerce.",

    "summary": "Competition between rival East India companies and private traders was said to have nearly ruined both companies.

This competition, however, was not allowed to last long. In 1702, the two companies were partially united by a tripartite indenture in which the queen was the third party. In 1708, they were fully consolidated by act of Parliament into a single entity under their current name: the United Company of Merchants Trading to the East Indies. A clause allowed the remaining separate traders to continue until Michaelmas 1711, while empowering the directors to redeem their small capital of seven thousand two hundred pounds on three years' notice, thereby converting the entire stock into a joint stock. Under the same act, the company's capital was increased from two million to three million two hundred thousand pounds in consequence of a new loan to the government.

It did, however, increase their trading stock, since it was equally exposed to the company's commercial losses and debts alongside the existing three million two hundred thousand pounds. From 1708, or at least from 1711, the company -- now free of all competitors and securely established in its monopoly of English trade to the East Indies -- carried on a successful trade and paid moderate dividends. During the French war beginning in 1741, the ambitions of Mr. Dupleix, the French governor of Pondicherry, drew the company into the wars of the Carnatic and into Indian political intrigues. After alternating signal successes and equally signal losses, they lost Madras, then their principal Indian settlement. It was restored by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Around this time, a spirit of war and conquest seems to have seized the company's servants in India and never left them. During the French war beginning in 1755, the company's military fortunes shared in Britain's general good luck. They defended Madras, captured Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta, and acquired the revenues of a rich and extensive territory said to yield upwards of three million pounds a year. They held this revenue peacefully for several years. But in 1767, the government claimed their territorial acquisitions and revenues as rightfully belonging to the crown. In compensation, the company agreed to pay the government four hundred thousand pounds annually. Before this, they had gradually raised their dividend from about six to ten per cent -- that is, on their capital of three million two hundred thousand pounds, they had increased annual payments from one hundred and ninety-two thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand pounds. They were then attempting to raise the dividend further to twelve and a half per cent, which would have made their annual payments to proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay the government: four hundred thousand pounds.",

After losing and recovering Madras, a spirit of conquest permanently seized its Indian servants. Military successes in the 1750s yielded territorial revenues of three million pounds annually.

It seems that the enormous increase in the company's fortune had only provided its servants with a pretext for greater extravagance and a cover for greater embezzlement, in proportion even beyond the increase of fortune itself.

In that philosophy, the duties of human life were treated as means to happiness and perfection in this life. But when moral philosophy, like natural philosophy, came to be taught only as preparation for theology, the duties of human life were treated as primarily means to happiness in the life to come. In ancient philosophy, the perfection of virtue was represented as necessarily producing the most perfect happiness in this life for the person who possessed it. In modern philosophy, virtue was frequently represented as generally, or even almost always, inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life. Heaven was to be earned only through penance and mortification, through the austerities and self-abasement of a monk, not through the liberal, generous, and spirited conduct of a citizen. Casuistry and ascetic morality made up, in most cases, the greater part of the moral philosophy taught in the schools. The most important branch of philosophy was thereby the most corrupted of all.",
    "elegant": "Ancient moral philosophy asked what makes a person happy and complete -- as individual, family member, citizen, and member of humanity -- treating life's duties as paths to earthly fulfillment.

Moral philosophy -- the most important branch -- became the most corrupted, reduced to casuistry and ascetic mortification.",

The ancient view (virtue produces happiness) vs. the medieval view (virtue requires earthly suffering) is a fundamental Enlightenment contrast. Smith clearly sides with the ancients. The shift from 'liberal, generous, and spirited conduct' to 'austerities and abasement of a monk' maps directly onto Smith's own moral philosophy in Theory of Moral Sentiments, which celebrates social virtues over ascetic ones. Casuistry -- the application of moral rules to particular cases -- is dismissed as a degenerate form of ethics.

These masters appear to have had neither salaries nor exclusive privileges of any kind. Their entire reward consisted of what they received from their students, and a citizen who had learned his exercises in the public gymnasium had no legal advantage over one who had learned them privately, provided the latter had learned them equally well. Those republics encouraged acquisition by bestowing small prizes and badges of distinction on those who excelled. To have won a prize at the Olympic, Isthmian, or Nemean games brought distinction not only to the winner but to his entire family and kindred.

In present times, that martial spirit alone, unsupported by a well-disciplined standing army, would probably not suffice for any society's defense. But where every citizen had the spirit of a soldier, a smaller standing army would be needed.

Maintaining even tolerable execution of the complex regulations of any modern militia, by contrast, requires continual and painful government attention, without which they constantly fall into complete neglect and disuse. The influence of the ancient institutions was also much more universal. Through them, the entire body of the people was fully instructed in the use of arms, whereas modern militia regulations can instruct only a very small portion of the population -- except, perhaps, in Switzerland. But a coward -- a man incapable of defending or avenging himself -- evidently lacks one of the most essential parts of a man's character. He is as mutilated and deformed in his mind as another person is in his body who has lost essential limbs or their use. He is clearly the more wretched of the two, because happiness and misery reside altogether in the mind and must therefore depend more on the mind's healthy or unhealthy, mutilated or whole state than on the body's. Even if the martial spirit of the people were of no use for national defense, preventing the sort of mental mutilation, deformity, and wretchedness that cowardice necessarily involves from spreading through the general population would still deserve government's most serious attention -- in the same way it would deserve the most serious attention to prevent a leprosy or other loathsome disease from spreading, even if neither fatal nor dangerous, because no other public good might result from such attention besides the prevention of so great a public evil.",

Even if martial spirit served no military purpose, preventing the spread of this mental deformity through the population would still deserve government's most serious attention, just as preventing a loathsome disease would.",

The more they are instructed, the less susceptible they are to the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition, which among ignorant nations frequently cause the most terrible disorders.

Those adversaries had generally allied with the losing political side, and were therefore its enemies too. Having thus become complete masters of the field, with their influence over the common people at its peak, the clergy of this victorious sect were powerful enough to overawe the leaders of their own party and to compel the civil magistrate to respect their opinions and desires. Their first demand was generally that he should silence and subdue all their adversaries. Their second was that he should bestow an independent provision on themselves. Since they had generally contributed considerably to the victory, it seemed not unreasonable that they should have some share of the spoils.

One may be called the strict or austere system; the other the liberal, or if you will, the loose system. The former is generally admired and revered by the common people; the latter is typically more esteemed and adopted by what are called the people of fashion. The principal distinction between these two systems lies in the degree of disapproval each assigns to the vices of levity -- the vices that tend to arise from great prosperity and from excessive gaiety and good humor. In the liberal or loose system, luxury, wanton and even disorderly merriment, the pursuit of pleasure to some degree of excess, the breach of chastity (at least in one of the two sexes), and similar indulgences -- provided they are not accompanied by gross indecency and do not lead to falsehood and injustice -- are generally treated with considerable indulgence, easily excused or pardoned altogether. In the austere system, on the contrary, those excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation. The vices of levity are always ruinous to common people -- a single week's thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to ruin a poor worker forever and to drive him, through despair, to commit the most terrible crimes. The wiser and better sort of common people, therefore, always regard such excesses with the utmost abhorrence, since experience tells them these indulgences are immediately fatal to people in their condition. Several years of disorder and extravagance, on the contrary, will not always ruin a man of fashion, and people of that rank are very apt to consider the power of indulging to some degree of excess as one of the advantages of their fortune, and the liberty to do so without censure or reproach as one of the privileges of their station. Among people of their own rank, therefore, they regard such excesses with only a small degree of disapproval, and censure them either very slightly or not at all.",

They differ mainly on the 'vices of levity' -- luxury, excess, sexual license. The poor cannot afford moral laxity: a single week of dissipation can permanently ruin a worker. So common people's morality strictly condemns what experience has taught them is fatal to their class. The wealthy can absorb years of excess without ruin, so they treat such indulgences as privileges of station and judge them leniently.",

While he remains in a country village, his conduct may be observed and he may be obliged to attend to it himself.

He never emerges so effectually from this obscurity, his conduct never attracts so much attention from any respectable group, as when he becomes the member of a small religious sect. From that moment he acquires a degree of consideration he never had before. All his fellow sect members, for the credit of the sect, have an interest in observing his conduct, and if he gives occasion for scandal -- if he deviates very much from the austere morals they almost always require of one another -- they punish him with what is always a very severe punishment, even when no other ill effects attend it: expulsion or excommunication from the sect.

Public diversions have always been objects of dread and hatred for all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies.

Their charity became gradually less extensive, their hospitality less generous or less lavish. Their retainers became consequently less numerous and, by degrees, dwindled away altogether.",

The ties of interest that had bound the lower ranks to the clergy were in this manner gradually broken and dissolved. They were broken and dissolved even sooner than those binding the same ranks to the great barons, because the benefices of the church, being for the most part much smaller than the estates of the great barons, the possessor of each benefice was much sooner able to spend its entire revenue on his own person.

The re-establishment of this ancient order was the aim of several statutes enacted in England during the fourteenth century, particularly the Statute of Provisors, and of the Pragmatic Sanction established in France in the fifteenth century. To make these elections valid, the sovereign needed both to consent to them beforehand and to approve the person elected. Though the election was still supposed to be free, the sovereign had all the indirect means that his position necessarily afforded him for influencing the clergy in his own dominions. Other regulations of a similar tendency were established in other parts of Europe. But the power of the pope in appointing the great benefices of the church seems, before the Reformation, to have been nowhere so effectively and universally restrained as in France and England.

This independence of the French clergy from the court of Rome seems to be principally founded on the Pragmatic Sanction and the Concordat. In earlier periods of the monarchy, the French clergy appear to have been as devoted to the pope as those of any other country. When Robert, the second prince of the Capetian line, was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of Rome, his own servants, it is said, threw the food from his table to the dogs and refused to taste anything that had been contaminated by contact with a person in his situation.

This tax therefore violates the first of the four maxims but satisfies the other three perfectly. It is entirely certain. Its payment timing matches the rent, making it as convenient as possible. Though the landlord is always the true taxpayer, the tenant usually advances the payment and deducts it from the rent. The tax requires far fewer collection officers than any other yielding comparable revenue. Since the tax on each district does not rise with rising rents, the sovereign does not share in the landlord's improvements. Those improvements sometimes help relieve other landlords in the district from their share of the tax, but any resulting increase on a particular estate is always so small that it never discourages improvement or suppresses the land's productivity. Having no tendency to reduce output, it cannot raise the price of produce. It does not obstruct industry and imposes no inconvenience on the landlord beyond paying the tax itself.

If he raised his profit rate proportionally to the tax, the whole tax, though he might advance it initially, would ultimately be paid by one of two different groups, depending on how he employed his capital. If he used it as farming capital to cultivate land, he could raise his profit only by keeping a larger share -- or the value of a larger share -- of the land's produce. Since this could only be done by reducing rent, the final payment would fall on the landlord. If he used it as commercial or manufacturing capital, he could raise his profit only by raising the price of his goods, in which case consumers would bear the final cost. If he did not raise his profit rate, he would have to charge the entire tax against the interest portion of his returns.

The ordinary rate of profit, as I showed in the first book, is everywhere determined by the ratio of capital available for employment to the amount of business to be done. Neither the business to be done nor the capital available would be increased or decreased by a tax on interest, so the ordinary profit rate would remain unchanged. The portion of profit needed to compensate the employer for risk and trouble would also remain the same, since neither the risk nor the trouble is affected.

Every hundred pounds of capital was accordingly supposed to be taxed at twenty-four shillings -- one-fifth of six pounds. Since the legal interest rate was reduced to five percent, every hundred pounds of capital is supposed to be taxed at only twenty shillings. The total sum to be raised by the land tax was divided between the countryside and the principal towns. The greater part was levied on the countryside, and of the portion levied on towns, most was assessed on houses. What remained to be assessed on the capital or trade of the towns -- since capital used on land was not meant to be taxed -- was far below the real value of that capital or trade. Whatever inequalities existed in the original assessment therefore caused little complaint. Every parish and district continues to be rated for its land, houses, and capital according to the original assessment, and the nearly universal prosperity of the country, which has greatly increased the value of all these in most places, has made those inequalities even less important. Moreover, since the rate on each district stays constant, the uncertainty of this tax, insofar as it applies to any individual's capital, has been greatly reduced. If most English land is not rated to the land tax at half its actual value, most English capital is probably rated at scarcely a fiftieth of its actual value.

But when a tax is imposed on profits from agricultural capital, it is not in the farmers' interest to withdraw any capital from farming. Each farmer occupies a certain amount of land for which he pays rent. Proper cultivation requires a certain amount of capital, and by withdrawing any part of this necessary capital, the farmer is unlikely to become more able to pay either his rent or the tax. To pay the tax, it can never be in his interest to reduce his output, nor consequently to supply the market more sparingly. The tax will therefore never enable him to raise prices so as to shift the burden onto consumers. Yet the farmer must earn his reasonable profit like any other businessman, or he must quit the trade. After such a tax is imposed, he can obtain this reasonable profit only by paying less rent to the landlord. The more he pays in tax, the less he can afford in rent.

The demand for labor -- according to whether it is increasing, stationary, or declining, and whether it requires a growing, stable, or shrinking population -- determines the worker's level of subsistence and whether it shall be generous, moderate, or meager. The average price of necessities determines the amount of money the worker must be paid to purchase this generous, moderate, or meager subsistence from year to year. So long as the demand for labor and the price of necessities remain unchanged, a direct tax on wages can have no effect other than to raise them somewhat above the tax. Suppose, for example, that in a particular place the demand and prices make ten shillings a week the ordinary wage, and a tax of one-fifth (four shillings per pound) is imposed on wages. If demand and prices stay the same, the worker must still earn a subsistence purchasable only for ten shillings a week, receiving ten shillings free and clear after paying the tax. To leave him such free wages after paying a one-fifth tax, the price of labor must soon rise not merely to twelve shillings but to twelve shillings and sixpence -- that is, to enable him to pay a one-fifth tax, his wages must rise not by one-fifth but by one-fourth.

The final burden would fall on different persons depending on the circumstances. The wage increase caused by such a tax in manufacturing would be advanced by the manufacturer, who would be both entitled and obliged to charge it, with a profit, onto the price of his goods.

The wage increase in agricultural labor would be advanced by the farmer, who, to maintain the same number of workers, would have to employ more capital. To recover this additional capital plus his normal profit, he would need to retain a larger portion of the land's produce, and consequently pay less rent to the landlord. The final burden of the agricultural wage increase would therefore fall on the landlord, together with the farmer's additional profit.

In some industries, moreover, coal is a necessary tool of production -- as in glass-making, ironworking, and all other metalworking. If a subsidy could ever be justified, it might perhaps be for transporting coal from where it is abundant to where it is scarce. But the legislature, instead of a subsidy, has imposed a tax of three shillings and threepence per ton on coastwise coal shipments -- which, for most types of coal, exceeds sixty percent of the original pithead price.

They do this in all four possible ways.\n\nFirst, levying these taxes, even when done most judiciously, requires a large number of customs and excise officers whose salaries and perquisites are themselves a real tax on the public that brings nothing into the treasury. This expense, it must be acknowledged, is more moderate in Britain than in most countries. In the year ending July 5, 1775, the gross product of excise duties managed by the excise commissioners in England was 5,507,308 pounds, collected at a cost of little more than five and a half percent. After deducting bounties and drawbacks on exported excisable goods, however, the net product falls below five million pounds. The net excise revenue after all deductions was 4,975,652 pounds. The customs are far more expensive to collect. Net customs revenue does not reach two and a half million pounds, yet the salaries of officers and other costs exceed ten percent of that amount. But customs officers' perquisites are everywhere much greater than their salaries -- at some ports more than double or triple. If salary costs alone exceed ten percent of net revenue, total collection costs including perquisites may reach twenty or thirty percent. Excise officers, by contrast, receive few or no perquisites, and the excise administration, being of more recent establishment, is generally less corrupted than customs, where long practice has introduced and sanctioned many abuses. By consolidating all malt and malt liquor revenue into a single malt tax, an estimated saving of more than 50,000 pounds per year could be achieved in excise expenses alone. Confining customs duties to a few goods and collecting them under excise-style rules could yield an even larger saving in customs expenses.",

If the taxed goods are domestically produced, less labor is employed in making them. If they are foreign goods made more expensive by the tax, domestic alternatives may gain an advantage in the home market, redirecting some industry toward producing them. But while this price increase may encourage one particular domestic industry, it necessarily discourages almost every other. The more a Birmingham manufacturer pays for foreign wine, the less his hardware is worth in exchange -- so he has less incentive to produce it. The more consumers in one country pay for another country's surplus, the less their own surplus is worth, and the less incentive they have to increase it. All taxes on consumable goods therefore tend to reduce productive labor below its natural level -- either in producing the taxed goods (if domestic) or in producing the goods exchanged for them (if foreign). Such taxes also always distort the natural direction of national industry, diverting it into channels that are different from, and generally less advantageous than, those it would naturally follow.",

Second, by making the gabelle, aides, traites, tobacco taxes, and all customs and excises uniform throughout the kingdom, collection costs could be greatly reduced and internal commerce freed to match England's.

During the reigns of William and Anne, large sums were frequently borrowed on annuities for various terms. In 1695, an act authorized borrowing one million pounds at an annuity of fourteen percent (140,000 pounds per year) for sixteen years. In 1691, an act authorized borrowing a million on life annuities at terms that would seem very favorable today, but the subscription was not filled. The following year, the shortfall was covered by borrowing on life annuities at fourteen percent -- barely more than seven years' purchase. In 1695, holders of these life annuities were allowed to exchange them for ninety-six-year annuities upon paying sixty-three pounds per hundred into the exchequer. In other words, the difference between fourteen percent for life and fourteen percent for ninety-six years was valued at only four and a half years' purchase -- so little confidence existed in government stability that even these terms attracted few buyers. Under Queen Anne, money was borrowed on annuities for lives and for terms of thirty-two, eighty-nine, ninety-eight, and ninety-nine years. In 1719, holders of the thirty-two-year annuities were persuaded to accept South Sea stock worth eleven and a half years' purchase plus stock equal to their arrears.

Ireland is certainly as able to pay a land tax as Great Britain, and our American and West Indian colonies are more able. Where a landlord is subject neither to tithes nor poor rates, he can certainly pay more land tax than one burdened by both. Tithes, where there is no negotiated fixed payment and they are collected in kind, reduce a landlord's potential rent more than a land tax amounting to five shillings per pound. Such a tithe typically amounts to more than a quarter of the actual rent remaining after the farmer has recovered his capital and a reasonable profit. If all negotiated fixed tithe payments and all impropriated tithes were eliminated, the full church tithe of Great Britain and Ireland could not be estimated at less than six or seven million pounds. Without any tithe, landlords could afford six or seven million more in land taxes without being worse off than many currently are. America pays no tithe and could therefore easily afford a land tax. American and West Indian lands, being generally worked directly by their owners rather than leased to tenants, could not be assessed by rent rolls.

The British merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular set of correspondents to whom it is more convenient to receive tobacco than gold and silver. They expect to make a profit from selling the tobacco; they could make none from selling gold and silver. Those metals therefore very seldom appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies. Maryland and Virginia have as little occasion for precious metals in their foreign trade as in their domestic commerce. They are said, accordingly, to have less gold and silver money than any other colonies in America. Yet they are regarded as being as thriving and consequently as wealthy as any of their neighbors.",
    "elegant": "In colonial external trade, gold and silver appear exactly where necessary and nowhere else. The tobacco colonies pay Britain in tobacco rather than precious metals because it is more convenient for both sides -- colonists keep their stock fully employed, and British tobacco merchants profit from reselling tobacco but would gain nothing from selling gold and silver. Maryland and Virginia therefore have less precious metal than any other colony, yet are among the most prosperous, demonstrating that scarcity of specie indicates efficient commerce rather than poverty. Just as any merchant would prefer to pay his correspondents in goods he deals in rather than in idle cash, the tobacco trade operates through commodity exchange that benefits all parties.",

The difficulty of obtaining payment from the various sugar colonies has been greater or smaller in proportion not to the size of their respective balances, but to the quantity of uncultivated land they contained -- that is, to the greater or lesser temptation for planters to overextend themselves by attempting to settle and cultivate more land than their capital could properly support.

    "refashioned": "It is not, therefore, colonial poverty that causes the present scarcity of gold and silver money in most colonies. Their strong demand for active, productive capital makes it convenient for them to hold as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them to content themselves with a cheaper, though less convenient, instrument of commerce than gold and silver. They are thereby able to convert the value that those metals would represent into tools of trade, clothing materials, household goods, and the ironwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and plantations -- acquiring productive stock rather than dead stock. In those branches of business that cannot be conducted without gold and silver money, they can always find the necessary quantity of those metals; and when they fail to find it, their failure is generally the result not of necessary poverty but of unnecessary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are poor that their payments are irregular, but because they are too eager to become excessively rich. Even if all colonial tax revenue beyond local government expenses were to be remitted to Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have ample resources to purchase the required quantity of those metals. They would simply need to exchange a portion of their surplus produce -- which they currently use to purchase productive stock -- for dead stock instead. In conducting their domestic business, they would be obliged to employ a costly instead of a cheap instrument of commerce, and the expense of purchasing this costly instrument might somewhat dampen the enthusiasm of their excessive enterprise in land improvement. It might not, however, be necessary to remit any part of the American revenue in gold and silver at all. It could be remitted in bills of exchange drawn upon and accepted by particular merchants or companies in Britain, to whom a part of America's surplus produce had been consigned. These merchants would pay the American revenue into the treasury in money, after having received the corresponding value in goods; and the entire business might frequently be transacted without exporting a single ounce of gold or silver from America.",

High demand for productive capital makes colonists prefer cheap paper over expensive metallic money, converting the value that gold and silver would represent into tools of trade, clothing materials, household goods, and ironwork for expanding their settlements -- acquiring productive stock rather than dead stock. When gold and silver are genuinely needed in business, they can always find the necessary quantity. When they fail, the cause is not necessary poverty but unnecessary and excessive enterprise -- overambitious expansion beyond their capital's reach. Even if all colonial tax revenue beyond local government expenses were remitted to Britain, it need not travel as precious metal.
